So I just recently shared the updated 1.6 villager paths maps, and have noticed a lot of weird behavior from the villagers. They have been veering off path and breaking things the normally wouldn't, and I now know why so I wanted to share with you all, now that BlaDe and his community helped confirm my suspicions.\n\nAs of the 1.6 update, villagers will avoid walking through terrain features like trees and... paths/flooring. Any floor or path you place down is classified as TerrainFeatures, which means they will avoid walking on them. You'll notice if you decorate the town like I do. They will search out the nearest space that is uncovered by \"terrain\", even if you put something on the spot like kegs or whatever. The same classification is applied to tilled soil and planted grass.\n\nThis can be super frustrating for decorators or those of you who expand out your profits by placing things in town/mountains/railroad etc.\n\nThis behavior is determined overnight, so resetting the day and moving your paths om a day of destruction unfortunately won't work, you'll have to load up your _old file of the day prior and remove them.\n\nI believe that the TerrainFeatures classification is why we have been getting forage on paths too.\n\nWhat else can you do? Well, you can place paths EVERYWHERE but just know that my paths maps won't be exact with that. I've noticed varried paths after I have tried this, so you'll have to do some mapping of your own.\n\nApart from removing all your paths, your best bet is to start placing furniture items around to protect your things. If you were unaware, you can take an item that says \"furniture\" as its category, like a table ornchair or junimo plush, and place it in the way of the villager.

There are two in all of Stardew Valley and Ginger Island. Having come out of a war recently(?), that makes some sense, but let\u2019s talk about that war for a second, the \u201celemental war\u201d.\n\nIn the sewer skirmish between the Dwarf and Krobus, the Wizard intervenes and says: \n\u201cThe Elemental Wars have long been finished.\u201d\nLong? For a seemingly immortal Wizard? That\u2019s a very long time indeed. Perhaps just after a certain people landed on the earth? \n\nLet me explain, in M. Jaspers book \u201cMysteries of the Dwarves\u201d he states the dwarves call themselves Smoluanu meaning the Sky People in their tongue. But they live underground? Well, if M. Jasper\u2019s theory is credible, as most of his writings are, they are an alien race from a distant planet. \n\nI agree with Jasper\u2019s work. I believe the dwarves were forced to flee from their home, and made as far as the planet where The Valley is situated. \n\nThe rest of this text I will write as if it is truth, but be reminded this is all purely speculative.\n\nThe ship split into pieces, parts to the mountains near The Valley, parts to the Ginger Volcano, parts to Calico Desert, and parts to the Gem Sea?\n\nFirstly, we will talk of The Valley dwellers. The Stone Dwarves. The dwarf we see in the mountain I believe to be a remnant of The Valley dwellers. These were the initiators of the Elemental Wars. Seeing inhabitants already on the surface, the survivors of the crash fled into the caves. Delving deeper and deeper to hide from the mining humans, the dwarves sparked conflict with the shadow people. Thus began the Elemental Wars of which I will not detail in this post.\n\nNow of the Volcano crashed. The Fire Dwarves. The Volcano Merchant is a fire dwarf. If you have ever gone through the ever shifting blobs of rock know as volcano floors, you have probably seen the dwarven wreckage. This I believe to be their part of the crash. There is not much more to go on of them, except they were masterful builders and smiths, and were advanced enough societally to have famous people, such as the \u201cCinderclown\u201d. It is likely the volcano erupted destroying all but the volcano merchant, and possibly trapping dwarf souls in flame, creating the sprites seen in the volcano.\n\nNow the Calico crash. An ancient civilization once lived there, as referenced in Penny\u2019s Desert Festival dialogue, and the skull cavern mummy floors, are those dwarves? I say yes. They made the skull cavern. The cavern is always moving, and a button controls dangerous monsters? The same for the mines? So, the dwarves make the mines and skull cavern change. The dwarves also mummified their dead and their souls change into ghosts if they aren\u2019t. \n\nThe Gem Sea Dwarves now. Have you seen the [ocean monster](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/images/f/f7/Sea_Monster_Anim.gif) near the beaches? I believe that\u2019s an ocean dwarf, it makes sense a crash would land in the ocean. Have you seen a [world map](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/images/7/76/World_Map.png) of The Valley Planet? \n\nSeeing the size of the ocean, it would make sense that a crash would land there, it\u2019s massive!

In fact, I am more appalled when I read that there are a few other extremely rare occurences, like a stone owl statue spawning or finding a garbage hat. We have all three of those. \n\nIs this more common on co-op or in recent updates, or do we simply have ridiculous luck? Considering the percentages I'm seeing online, I simply can't believe we've had the three of them on a first game without knowing they were even supposed to be uncommon."]},

To make it easier, all the numbers I used are the numbers for 100 farm squares, but if you have a huge farm and have more space, you can just divide my numbers by 100 and multiply them by your number of squares, and you\u2019ll be able to see how much money you would make. Also, I calculated all the prices with artisan and tiller professions since none of the crops get any benefit from agriculturist\n\n**So first, I needed to see how many crops I would get, since cranberries produce more than pumpkins.**\n\nCranberry plants give on average 2,1 cranberries when harvested, and keep producing every 5 days all season. This means at the end of the season, you get an average of 1 050 cranberries. Unfortunately, even with the best speed-gro fertilizer AND agriculturist profession, it is impossible to get more than 5 harvests on cranberries. This means for 100 cranberry seeds, you\u2019ll always get an average of 1050 cranberries in one season. \n\nPumpkins always give 1 pumpkin per harvest. I decided not to count giant crops since it is very rare and it is very unlikely that you get one, and even if you do, it doesn\u2019t make much of a difference with big amounts of crops, and it made the math a big pain in the ass. Anyways, they take 13 days to grow and don\u2019t regrow after being harvested, meaning you need to buy seeds from Pierre twice in the season to get 200 pumpkins. However, with deluxe speed-growing fertilizer, you end up just in time to get a third harvest, to get 300 pumpkins instead. Unfortunately, even with agriculturist, you can\u2019t get the extra harvest without fertilizer, so it\u2019s pretty much useless in this scenario too.\n\n**Now, I had to know how many crops of each quality I would get after harvest, and how much it would sell for, plus the eventual effects of fertilizers**\n\nFor cranberries (and all crops that give more than one fruit per harvest), only the first fruit has a chance to not be normal quality. This means on the average of 2,1 cranberries per harvest, the second and the eventual third cranberry will always be regular quality. With that in mind, I calculated that with no fertilizer, you would get on average 780 normal, 165 silver and 105 gold cranberries, adding up to 93 705$, minus 24 000$ for buying the seeds, which brings us to a total of 69 705$.\n\nBut not using fertilizer is boring, right? So with deluxe fertilizer, you can\u2019t get normal quality crops, however, only the first fruit is affected, so for each harvest, there will always be 1,1 cranberries that are normal quality. In the whole season, for 1150 cranberries, that means 550 would be normal, and on average, you would get 55 silver, 240 gold and 205 iridium cranberries, adding up to a total of 114 055$, and once you subtract the price of the seeds, you get a nice 90 055$\n\nFor pumpkins, it\u2019s easier because there is no need to bother about only the first fruit being harvested, however, we need to see which fertilizer is the best. So for speed-gro, you get 300 pumpkins, with on average 138 normal, 99 silver and 63 gold pumpkins, for a total of 125 400$, minus 30 000 for the seeds, and you get 95 400$ in the end, which is a bit more than cranberries with deluxe fertilizer, however, I find speed-gro fertilizer much more expensive to make.\n\nBut what about deluxe fertilizer for pumpkins? Deluxe fertilizer never gives normal quality crops, so you get on average 22 silver, 96 gold and 82 iridium pumpkins, which adds up to 118 096$. Oh so let\u2019s not bother about that, speed-gro is better right? WRONG! Since you produce only twice in the season, you only need to buy 200 seeds, for 20 000$. When you subtract that amount to get the final price, you get 98 096, which is a bit more than speed-gro. And since deluxe fertilizer is easier to make, if you don\u2019t plan on processing the crops, it\u2019s actually better than the speed-gro.\n\n**Finally, I needed to see after processing. I already proved that pumpkins were better, but I needed to be sure**\n\nCranberries in a keg are worth 315$. Quality doesn\u2019t affect kegs, so the math is simple. 1050 x 315$ = 330 750. After subtracting the seeds, you get a huge 306 750$ for only 100 cranberry seeds in one season, plus the time to process the crops.\n\nPumpkins are one of the few vegetables who are actually better in kegs than jars. Pumpkin juice sells for 1008$, multiplied by 300 pumpkins (because there is no reason to take deluxe fertilizer over speed-gro when processing), gives a total of 302 400$, which means even if seeds were free, cranberries would still be better. But seeds aren\u2019t free, and after removing their price, you get 272 400. Btw, this is the only number here that is not an average, since if you do all properly, you will always get exactly one pumpkin per seed, and quality has no effect.\n\nSo yeah, that\u2019s how I spent my evening, hope at least it helped some of you. I also hope this wasn\u2019t covered like last week, cause I might be a little pissed, but otherwise, enjoy!\n\n**TLDR**: If you have more kegs than you know what to do with, cranberries give about 30 000$ more per 100 crops. If you can\u2019t process your crops because you have more starfruit than you know what to do with, pumpkins with deluxe fertilizer are better by a bit less than 10 000$\n\nAlso, english isn\u2019t my first language.

 {"permalink": "/r/StardewValley/comments/1citc72/the_code_for_rice_in_the_game_is_actually_super/", "id": "1citc72", "title": "The code for Rice in the game is actually super weird, and it does something no other crop does.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/StardewValley/comments/1citc72/the_code_for_rice_in_the_game_is_actually_super/", "selftext": "I've made a pretty strange discovery in the code. So, I was looking through the game code trying to figure out what the exact effect of your Farming Skill level and Luck is on the number of extra crops you get, for crops that can produce more than 1 per harvest (like say Blueberry). Turns out Luck doesn't have any effect at all, and Farming Skill level only affects a single crop in the entire game for some reason: Rice.\n\nThe way it works in the code, is if the crop can have more than 1 per harvest, is it randomly selects a number it calls num1 (the base number of harvested items produced) that has a 50/50 chance of being *either* the minimum amount of items that can be produced, or the *maximum of* either of these values (values are listed for each crop in Crops.xnb):\n\n* minHarvest + 1\n* maxHarvest + 1 + (Farming Skill Level / maxHarvestIncreasePerFarmingLevel, only added if the latter is greater than 0)\n\nNo crops have a minHarvest value higher than maxHarvest, so the first option actually can't happen in a vanilla game (I'm not even sure why it's there...). But what's important here is the way Farming Skill level is added to the equation. Farming Skill level only has an effect *if maxHarvestIncreasePerFarmingLevel is greater than 0*. And guess what?\n\nPretty much all crops with extra harvests have maxHarvestIncreasePerFarmingLevel set to 0. Potato, Strawberry, Tomato, Blueberry, Pepper, Coffeebean, Eggplant, Cranberry, and Fiber, all of are set to 0 and all of them are completely unaffected by your farming level when it comes to the amount you harvest. There is only a single crop in the entire game with maxHarvestIncreasePerFarmingLevel set to something other than 0. That crop is Rice, which has it set to 10.\n\nThis means that Rice is actually the only crop in the entire game for which Farming Skill level has an effect besides crop quality. If you were to buff your Farming level, by eating for example Farmer's Lunch, you will on average harvest more rice per plant. And this buff doesn't work for any other crop at all! So if you're planning a massive rice harvest on the Riverland map, make sure you eat a proper lunch first.\n\nThe code for the whole thing, if anyone was curious, looks like this:\n\n    if ((int) (NetFieldBase<int, NetInt>) this.minHarvest > 1 || (int) (NetFieldBase<int, NetInt>) this.maxHarvest > 1)\n        {\n        int num5 = 0;\n        if (this.maxHarvestIncreasePerFarmingLevel.Value > 0)\n            num5 = Game1.player.FarmingLevel / (int) (NetFieldBase<int, NetInt>) this.maxHarvestIncreasePerFarmingLevel;\n        num1 = random.Next((int) (NetFieldBase<int, NetInt>) this.minHarvest, Math.Max((int) (NetFieldBase<int, NetInt>) this.minHarvest + 1, (int) (NetFieldBase<int, NetInt>) this.maxHarvest + 1 + num5));\n        }\n        if ((double) (NetFieldBase<double, NetDouble>) this.chanceForExtraCrops > 0.0)\n        {\n            while (random.NextDouble() < Math.Min(0.9, (double) (NetFieldBase<double, NetDouble>) this.chanceForExtraCrops))\n            ++num1;\n        }\n\nAs to what it does with chanceForExtraCrops at the bottom there, it just checks if chanceForExtraCrops > 0.0, and if it is, compares chanceForExtraCrops from Crops.xnb to a random number between 0.0 and 1.0 and sees if chanceForExtraCrops is greater than that random number. If the check succeeds, it adds 1 to the num1 we calculated before, and repeats the check again, continuing until the check fails. Ultimately, num1 after this is the amount of harvested items that will be produced.", "score": 656, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "created_utc": 1714690408.0, "num_comments": 25, "comments": ["Could be CA breadcrumbing for the modders.

So unfortunately buffing your farming skill to 13 won't get you more rice. Sad.\n\nAlso, while I said that \"Luck doesn't have any effect at all\", this isn't *exactly* true. There is a veeeery small luck-based chance that all crops, not just multi-item crops, have to double their harvest. This takes into account both daily luck and your luck level from food/item buffs.\n\nAnyway, off I go to update the wiki and correct the wrong values on there for average rice/plant...", "Oh man I\u2019m so curious to read over the game code (I\u2019m a new web dev and curious to see what game dev looks like in comparison)\n\nIs it open source?

However, I'd get parents' permission before gifting the youngest the game (and delay both if you think getting only one the game would cause issues)\n\nthe only non age appropriate thing i can think of is sams depression and drinking, which would be up to the parents to explain. (alcoholism and depression/suicidal thoughts) a good parent explains it and frames it in a way that the child understands the basics, but not the full horrible nature of both, and that they can come tp the parents if they begin to feel similar.\n\noutside of that, the only other thing is very vaguely implied sex scenes (Lewis's underwear in marnie's bedroom, and a dating cutscene that fades to black and has the partner remark that the previous day was fun, referring to both the (possible) sex or just the day spent together. both of these can either be explained or handwaved depending on the parents' choice.", "I let my oldest start playing at 6.5yo.

She asks about my \"romances\" and I explain to her what's happening, where I'm at, etc.\n\nShe loves talking to everyone, and when she's not sure how to respond, we talk about it and I provide her some additional context for how to respond (Sure, you can absolutely tell Pierre he's being greedy, but how do you think he would respond to that? Do you think you'll lose hearts?) and sort of use it as a way to understand how different responses can be perceived in different ways and each of those have different outcomes. You can absolutely say whatever you'd like, but if you don't get the outcome you wanted we quickly chat about the \"why\".\n\nI too have ADHD (very recently diagnosed) and I'm confident she does as well (were going through the process) and I find it a helpful way to teach her how to work with her brain. It's a great way to set little goals, small goals and big goals. I always try to make sure she understands how to \"plan\". It's so easy to lose focus in-game (and in real-life) that finding ways to help her learn to adjust/regulate her focus has been really helpful.\n\nIs that silly? Maybe! I dunno!

Absolutely! It's what my brain does! Lol\n\nAll this to say, I think your nieces would love it!

This doesn't even touch movies for child audiences that are generally on the darker side, like Coraline. Even Harry Potter goes quite dark at times and starts with \"btw, here's a kid with dead parents who is forced to live with his abusive relatives.\" \n\nI don't know if they still do anti-drugs episodes in shows for children but looking back, almost every popular cartoon I watched as a kid had at least one episode about drug use or alcohlism and some of them got darker and spelt things out more bluntly than Shane's recovery arc. \n\nMost media for kids also has innuendos or subtle (and sometimes not so subtle) adult humor that usually flies right over the kids's heads until they reach their maybe mid-teens.\n\nLevel of expertise: None. I don't have children. But I used to be a child and I still love shows, games, books, and movies for kids, even if I haven't caught up with what kids watch nowadays \ud83d\ude01  \nOn a more serious note, if you think of what the kids in your charge usually like to watch, and really think about what's happening in those movies and shows, it's usually easy to answer whether they can handle a game like Stardew. Don't underestimate those youngsters, they usually not only are mature enough to stomach serious themes, many of them enjoy it when they can consume/interact with media that gives their minds and imagination something to do. They're also perceptive. Unless they are forced to live a sheltered, secluded life, they know that many of the more serious things in the game exist in our world. They probably know that alcohol, relationships, war, etc. exist. Or abusive (step)parents (I mean...Cinderella?). Or dead parents (every Disney movie).\n\nIf they are confused and ask about something, I think the best and most respectful approach is to be honest. Age-appropriate when it comes to wording and details, but honest. Usually, I'd also add to talk with the parents beforehand in case there are topics they'd rather talk with their kids about (so you could tell the kids \"That's something for your parents to explain\" if they asked you) but at 7 and 12, I don't think there's anything in Stardew that they haven't encountered already in the media or real world. \n\n~~let's be real, the tavern scene in The Great Mouse Detective alone has probably many more Oooh moments that led to kids having questions and questioning themselves than the entirety of Stardew lol~~", "My 10 y/o says it, he doesn't care for the social aspect of it, he dungeons' and farms mostly", "i'd say any age, since its pretty tame. if shane, lewis and caroline are a bother you can possibly get them to play it modded maybe?", "Get them in the fields ASAP.

I could write a huge post about every topic, but it would be huge, but here's some points as to why\n     \u00b0The HM series barely evolved past 90s game design philosophy\n    \u00b0Hm series has horrible accessibility.\n    \u00b0 Hm has awful customization options, replayability, and representation.\n    \u00b0Hm has next to no after launch support\n\n\nStardew valley is a example of when too much freedom starts to actually make the game worse. Sounds insane, I know, but basically what I mean is that the player children will never grown up because the player has to always have to option to get rid of them, and getting rid of a npc that has relationships with the valley can lead to massive problems and all the bachelors and bachelorettes will never follow their dreams and have their character arc unfinished because the player always has the option to divorce their current spouse and erase their memory. And all these years playing the game and being a part of the fanbase I've only seen very few people actually using these options and I hate how because of a small portion of the playerbase, that means the rest of us will never get these requested features because the game has accommodated these choices. Ofc there's more reasons as to why, but it fells like this is the biggest reason.\n\n 1.6 actually fells bloated and a lot of the new content added kinda makes the pacing worse. Mastery is excellent and the desert festival is great, but the raccoon bundles, mystery boxes, prize tickets, bookseller, just felt unnecessary IMO, and we're only added so the update would have some content to it.\n\nIf a 1.7 update ever happens, I genuinely hope it focus on  the characters because they are the weakest point in the game. Like, barely anything is ever done with some of them and every update genuinely feels a missed opportunity to fixes their problems like:\n           \u2022Jodi's family is extremely underdeveloped, Jodi is always overworked and no one from her family ever helps her, Kent does literally nothing after he gets introduced on Y2, and I know he is suffering from the war, but the fact that he barely even acknowledges Vicent existence is just awful IMO, Sam never changes or growns and Vincent is the definition of a NPC.\n          \u2022The game does the sin of \"A character never has its arc finished because I didn't date them\" for example, Maru will only finish her robot if you date her, or Abigail will never grown out of her shell and finally pursue the life of a adventurer because they have to be available for the player.\n         \u2022Sandy is there and sad that she never does anything\n         \u2022 Linus clearly has something going on with his past and his hermit lifestyle.", "Oh look another karma farm low effort UnPopUlAr OpiNioNs and HoT TakeS post", "Especially when the disliked characters are just people who have realistic issues, and struggle with alcoholism, anxiety, depression and the like.", "I'm so tired of all the Pierre hatred.

Many of them have gone so far that they blame Caroline's possible cheating and lying behaviour on him. Does anyone seriouly believe that \"not getting enough attention from spouse\" is a good reason to have an affair and manipulate spouse into raising the affair child? Some even say that Caroline \"sacrifices\" herself for her daughter to stay with Pierre....this is sooooo baffling!

He definitely got laid off.\n\nAnd I'm pretty sure he had wife and kids too, I don't want to imagine how disappointed in him they are then...\n\n\nOr... like how *the whole village* started swarming Maurice when he offered the coupons. \n\n\"It's all about community\", my ass! They never really talk, they don't move their asses to get the community center back up. Exept for Gus they don't even try and help Linus, Pam, Shane, nor Granny with taking care of George! And then they cry \"wolf\" because of a big-city-company taking root? Wow.", "I don\u2019t understand all the Demetrius hate! Granted, I\u2019ve never romanced Sebastian, so don\u2019t know how dialogue for that approach, but I know people don\u2019t like his responses if you romance Maru or when he brings home tomatoes for a \u201cfruit\u201d. But I\u2019ve always thought his protectiveness of Maru was kind of sweet, because we can see that, yeah, she IS a genius who could go far! She builds a freaking robot! Although I will admit, maybe my own parental issues are making me biased. \n\nAnd the whole bringing home tomatoes for fruit salad thing just makes me laugh now, because it felt like a little self-aware jab at the trope of husbands can\u2019t grocery shop. \n\nI don\u2019t know, I get why he wouldn\u2019t be a favorite for some people but the hate just feels over the top!", "Wow, I actually kinda agree with that Penny take. Explains why I just don't like her as much as I should. Still feels bad for her though.\n\nIt'd be the more religious villagers for me. Linus and Krobus are cool in-game, but IRL I'd probably like them much less. Emily is fine though; she never uses her beliefs as a crutch to replace proper treatments, and doesn't force anyone to follow her lifestyle. If anything, she'd have a lot less right to complain since she works at a bar that overserves customers with unhealthy food all the time.\n\nI also can't relate to Sebastian for some reason despite using to be just like him. I think he's a bit too cynical? Though I do like Shane a lot more, so don't take me seriously.", "My hot take is that Linus is a fucking idiot and a threat to himself. When you're old, you *need* proper shelter and a medical safety net. It's not a lifestyle matter.", "I don't hate Pierre at all, for me he is more of a comedic character. Also, I never have the idea of \"rescuing Caroline\" from her marriage -- she is living a life with some flaws but still decent, she and Pierre are a good match.\n\n* Caroline doesn't work at all, all she does for their store is occasionally telling the farmer \"we have seeds, come by if you need any\".\n* As a housewife, she doesn't do much housework either -- when talking about making dinner, she is either >!\"Well, I'll just do takeaway from the bar\"!<, or>!\"let me see how I can make Pierre to cook dinner\"!<.\n* So Pierre may be a dick towards the farmer, but he's quite nice to his wife. He not only provides for her but also shares chores with her, so all she needs to do is \"relax and think positive\". Compared to Jodi who is also a housewife, Caroline has so much more time to herself. She can also afford fancy \u00a0jewelries, thanks to her greedy money-making husband. She totally benefits from his greediness. \n* They both keep secrets from each other. It's heavily implied that Caroline may have cheated on her husband and lied to him so he raises a child who is not his. On Pierre's part, on top of his \"secret stash\", a couple of his lines also start with \"don't tell my wife\". But Caroline's secret is much worse, it's totally unfair to blame her cheating and lying behaviour on him (unless Pierre's secret stash is gay porn or letters to his lover etc)\n* Some Pierre haters have gone so far that they picture Caroline as a submissive wife who keeps herself small in their falimy because of her \"brutal\" husband. I found this so ridiculous! I mean, he confesses to the farmer that he hates cooking dinner, yet he asks you to not tell his wife and cooks dinner anyway. He doesn't dare to confront his wife with the origin of their daughter either. How come anyone would imagine him as the dominant brutal king of the family?\n* As a couple who have stayed married for more than 20 years, they are weirdly not that close. You would see Jodi and Kent, Robin and Demetrius doing things together quite often, but not the case for Caroline and Pierre. They both seem to enjoy their own life. Pierre is all about making money and expanding his business, or practicing opera/going to the bar on his own for leisure.  Caroline is living a community-oriented life involving gardening, doing aerobics class and hanging out with her friends. She also has her sunroom and she goes to the library.  There's actually only once she complains about her husband not spending time with the family. I'm not sure how much she really cares. \n* Sometimes, they give me a vibe that they are not on the same page in life because they don't talk to each other a lot. Caroline is aware that Pierre is ambitious but she believes that he will always put his family first; while Pierre once confesses to the farmer that he's bored with domestic life and wants to pursuit business sucess. Well....\n* The couple has one thing in common though: being a control freak towards their daughter. Pierre, no need to explain, see Abigail's six hearts event. Caroline, almost half of her dialogues are about \"I hope my daughter would behave the way I want her to\". On Flower Dance, Abigail would tell you that>!she doesn't want to dance, but her mom MADE her to.!<\n* They seem to be a dysfunctional couple, but they still care about each other. Pierre would prepare a surpise romantic dinner for his wife. As the only breadwinner of the family, he also helps with the housework. On one of the festivals, Caroline would say>!she should make some food for her husband as he's doing business for the whole day.!<She would also stay close to Pierre's stall on festivals to spend time together. She cares when he lost the grange display. Actually, data mining into the game code shows that they are each other's only love interest, they love each other.", "I am also a Clint lover. I think he\u2019s awkward. He hasn\u2019t received any negative attention from Emily, she includes him in her events and is happy to be in his video. He\u2019s not a bad man. Just extremely shy. I wish he was a marriage candidate", "I don't understand hate in general. Why there are people here who feels hatred towards a character who doesn't even exist and won't under any circumstance affect their real life?\n\nThere are characters I like, there are characters I don't care, but I just don't have any worse feelings about none of them.\n\nI dislike Penny's behavior towards George, but I don't hate her. I dislike Lewis laziness on managing the village, but I don't hate him. I dislike Demetrius behavior towards me because of Maru, but I don't hate him. And so on.", "Clint isn't just a \"socially awkward guy\", he acts like a nice guy. He tells you you have \"won\" if you date Emily, as if she was an object, and he stops interacting with her if you marry her. There's also the fact that he still talks about wanting to be with Emily even when you marry her, like... yeah, it's probable CA not changing the dialogue when he should but other characters change dialogues if you marry certain characters, so...\n\nHe also asks you to give Emily an amethyst that YOU have to get, but he pretends to take all the credit. Sorry, but that's not someone trying to be romantic but failing because of social awkwardness. At least go to the mines to get the amethyst or even buy it somewhere, what's the point if I'm the one that's gonna do all the job? What is Clint doing for her there?\n\nAs for unconventional takes... I don't know how unconventional these are but:\n\n1. Sebastian is a lot more mature than people give him credit for. He admits almost if not all his mistakes (he admits he's the one mostly responsible for his relationship with Maru, he admits he should stop smoking, he apologizes after accusing Maru of being \"just an attention-grabbing scam\"...), he has a job (yes, he has a job, I don't get why people act as if he was just playing videogames in his computer all day), he clearly loves his mom and cares a lot about her...\n2. Alex's not that bad at the start, not even with the female farmer. He only has like one sexist dialogue, and it's not that bad. He was raised by his grandpa, and considering the fact he is homophobic and sexist, its just common sense that Alex was also raised by those standards. All in all, if anything Alex is not as bad as he could be, specially since his only paternal role model was George. But it's not even like he thinks women are just inferior, he just assumes you don't wanna play with him because he assumes women don't like that kind of thing, but in fact, the correct answer there is to tell him you actually wanna play with him, which means he isn't against a woman playing sports, he just doesn't expect it.\n3. People is obsessed with hating Elliott for the most stupid reasons and I don't get it. People seem to believe Elliott is a rich guy when he literally lives in a shitty cabin and even tells you at some point that his bank account is running dry. They also hate him because he gives you wine instead of beer if you are female and like... it's not that bad and, tbh, wine is usually more expensive than wine so... good for the female farmer, lol. As for the boat scene... you're fucking dating??? What's so bad about kissing your boyfriend/girlfriend in a clearly romantic date? The game makes it kind of weird giving you the option to say you are uncomfortable but that's all. And if you tell him that, he just takes you back and the event ends, so he didn't have any ill intentions AT ALL in that scene. Also, let's not forget that most of the bachelors/bachelorettes kiss you without consent and Harvey even kiss you IN A FUCKING HOT AIR BALLOON.\n4. You are not ableist for hating/criticizing Demetrius or Shane. Just because Demetrius may be written like an stereotypical autistic person or because Shane has depression and an addiction doesn't exempt them for criticism. Demetrius is an awful step-father and a not so great husband and Shane is an asshole for a really long time. He also doesn't have that much personality apart from his depression and addiction and he doesn't work as a marry-able character at all. Also, Demetrius may be autistic, but he's written by a non-autistic person and it shows.\n5. Also, Shane deprived as of the opportunity to marry Linus or Rasmodius, whom are A LOT more interesting than Shane, so fuck you, Shane.\n6. Haley is also not as bad as people make her out to be, she's just rude at first (probably not intentional, just not really caring about anything that she's not interested in, tbh), but she grows like any other character. Shane is rude for a longer time (in my experience, at least) than her but people are a lot more forgiving with him. Also, let's not forget that in the event where she argues with Emily about chores, the correct answer is to tell her to do what Emily's asking for.\n7. Penny is boring AF and she's not even that good of a person. I don't like some of her events: in her first event, she helps George and moves his wheelchair without his consent, which is just wrong, but the correct answer is to tell her she did good and you lose friendship with her if you tell her she should've asked. Then she cooks something that's definitely not edible and the correct answer is to LIE to her. She's written as a \"good girl\" and she's a fucking teacher, she should know more than anyone that you shouldn't lie to others just to make them feel good, you should tell them the truth so they can improve. And finally, when you are already dating her, Vincent tells you that he saw Penny and Sam climbing a tree or something like that and then Penny panics telling you that you shouldn't believe what Vincent says, which is sus AF. And yes, I know CA said it was platonic... but come on! Why would she act that way if it were platonic? Also, let's not forget how SV bachelors/bachelorettes come in \"pairings\" and Penny and Sam are one of them.\n8. And finally, because this is already too long, Alex and Sebastian are the best written and complex bachelors by far. Bonus points to Elliott and Haley because they're great.", "Nnnnope, I am on team Clint-Hate, he is just sich a \"nice guy\" , I had a friend like him in my 20s. \n\nI never got the Popular Penny hate. She is a trad-wife, so what?", "Two HoT TakE posts in a row \ud83d\udc80", "he is just a cute, little spooky boy :3", "Maybe he's probably written to be likeable and quirky and so doesn't have as many flaws as the other NPCs do.

It would make him more interesting.", ">they don\u2019t move their asses \n\nI mean, I don\u2019t *expect* CA to develop dialogue, action, coding, etc for the characters to help out..but I would be nice if the characters contributed a BIT to the community center.

My dad wasn\u2019t always the nicest or most tactful, was very much a logic-oriented person first and emotional person second, and was fiercely protective of me my entire life. He didn\u2019t want anything to happen to me and would sometimes do irrational things that I\u2019d have to have a convo with him about later. He\u2019d explain it as \u201cI apologize for being a brute, but I have one daughter in this lifetime and I am going to ensure no one ever hurts you . That\u2019s how much I love you .\u201d I love him for that. His initial heart scene where he\u2019s looking out for Maru never really bothered me that much because of that. \n\nNow I\u2019m getting emotional at work, but that\u2019s why I hold Demetrius\u2019  character so close to my heart. It\u2019s like I can still see a piece of my dad even when he\u2019s not here anymore. I\u2019ll always be able to open up the game and go say hi to Demetrius, and be reminded of my dad, even if for a moment. I\u2019ll thank CA for that every day of my life.", "I talked just like Sebastian when I was like 14 lol\n\nThe cringe is what makes Sebastian feel more human and less sanitised.\n\nAdding on I feel like Penny would have a \u201ckeep sweet\u201d voice\n\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/t/ZPRwaUBcW/", "Especially later on when he >!becomes Leo's guardian.!<Like, first of all how does he even become *approved* for that without a proper house, but seriously dude...>!kid's already experienced his parental figures dying on him once, don't do that to him again!!<Take better care of yourself!", ">data mining into the game \n\nIf you data mine into other couples, are there *other* love interests???", "Maybe it's just me, but why do I feel like Krobus has only like 10 different lines being repeated every time I visit him in the sewers? Idk if having him as a roomate would be better, but I definitely wished he'd had more character as well. Same thing with Sandy, really.\n\nIn the same vein, Willy, Gus, Robin etc. are similarly \"little to no flaws\" characters, but I feel like they're more interesting because you get to interact and know them more.", "I\u2019m sorry to hear about your father. I definitely ugly-cried the first time I got the third year Grandpa cutscene and he said he was proud of all I accomplished.", "Oh, I absolutely get where Sebastian is coming from. I just can't relate to him, strangely. I must admit I always feel a little \"detached\" emotionally, so maybe that's the reason? Also because I'm more realist, so I always dislike people who are pessimistic haha\n\n**Edit:** On the voices, I now realize Penny and Emily are the exact opposite on how they deal with their emotions.\n\nEmily is emotionally mature, is an actual believer and never acts irrational, while Penny gets too emotional at times and would be more likely to attach herself to beliefs to soothe her pain.\n\nNow, I imagine Emily's voice would be more deep suavity like the vocals in her theme song or the mermaid show.", "I mean, some may think there might be love interest between the wizard and Caroline due to the possible affair, but it's actually \"null\" for the wizard and only Pierre for Caroline. Also, Marnie's love interest is Lewis but Lewis' is \"null\"....", "Yeah, that's the case for a handful of the NPCs and I wish they got more dialogue (thankfully we got some in 1.6). I have Krobus as my roommate pretty much every save but he's still quite repetitive, though I'm pretty sure that's the case for all spouses. He's a lot of fun, I just wish his 14-heart event was more interesting. It's cute, but that's it.\n\nI believe Gus is a bit of a pushover, that's the impression I got during that scene where you make Pam pay her bill, at least that's an interesting trait he has. Robin you could argue has some family issues she could be more involved in like Sebastian and Demetrius' relationship. I'm not sure what Willy and Sandy have that could count as \"flaws,\" but I still find them cool.", "Oof. That marine one.

With only 5 treasure totems, I got 14 golden coconuts and since 1/7 of golden coconut is a banana sapling, from those 14 golden coconuts, I got 2 banana saplings.\n\n  The places where I always use my totems are in the Dig site (in front of the mushroom cave after cleaning all the rocks) and on the Island farm. Specifically the area where the mussel nodes spawn, just look for this crescent-shaped mark (example image) and stand on it, the 16 artifact locations will spawn without problem. I say this in case you are low on treasure totems and don't want to risk a couple of artifact spots not spawning because they will appear only in tillable ground.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cz9kq7lw2yxc1.png?width=743&format=png&auto=webp&s=e5e8e980a83a421fec888c95ef35acbb0e6f322a\n\n[That butterfly is making fun of my demonstration...](https://preview.redd.it/danad2xc7yxc1.png?width=692&format=png&auto=webp&s=96da58d76dd545111f5da412b3bc8feca60738c0)\n\n[Loot from 5 Treasure Totems.](https://preview.redd.it/e7q5dge28yxc1.png?width=1038&format=png&auto=webp&s=e90c5869f14ff6600d8dcb3ab30ed44578e34e2f)\n\n[2 Banana Saplings from 14 Golden Coconuts.](https://preview.redd.it/2289u5o58yxc1.png?width=906&format=png&auto=webp&s=441a66943a412354f2bf11a7e0a8b227af84abc0)\n\n And, if for some reason you have already unlocked Mastery before accessing the island (like in my case, I reached level 10 in all skills after completing the Community center and chose Foraging Mastery first) in my opinion, once you unlock the western part of the island and, if you have previously put tappers on some mystical trees, I think you could get the banana sapling more quickly (but instead of being 1/7 golden coconut is a banana sapling, chances are reduced to 14%, if memory serves me right, please check the wiki!). Collecting 5 dragon tooth also takes a lot of time and many attempts and the same goes for completing the collection of the large animal from the Island Field Office, so you could try this method if you are already producing Mystic syrup in large quantities, to craft Blue grass starter. With this method you will also obtain a lot of omnigeodes (which you can trade for artifact troves), skill books (like in the example I got 3 Jack Be Nimble, Jack be Thick), and Mystery boxes (depending on luck and later, >!you can exchange 3 with certain npc for golden Mystery boxes, increasing your chances of getting auto-petters)!<. I know many people will wonder why it is important to get the banana sapling quickly: you need a banana to complete a certain puzzle on the island to get golden walnuts and access Mr. Qi's walnut room faster. And in itself, banana is the most profitable tree fruit, to plant on the island or in the greenhouse.\n\n  I found this method of obtaining banana saplings to be faster and more reliable than gathering 5 dragon thoot (save those for Totems or the Obelisk!) or shaking trees on the island every day to exchange 10 coconuts for a golden one, so I wanted to share it with all of you!", "score": 36, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "created_utc": 1714628729.0, "num_comments": 6, "comments": ["Adding a tip to your tip!\n\nFor this bit,\n\n> don't want to risk a couple of artifact spots not spawning because they will appear only in tillable ground \n\nBit tedious, and maybe a waste of time, but you can use your pickaxe on the tilled land to turn it back to untilled relatively quickly, then you can use another in the same space and it'll work as if it were brand new.", "You also need bananas for an Obelisk, and when you have bidirectional obelisk travel 'just' popping over to the other farm gets easy.", "wtf is a treasure totem!?!", "I have a section of the island farm cleared for totems because they\u2019re so busted on the island, I use it, search the bottom two spots on each side and then pick axe them, then go back to the middle and go down a tile and use another totem.

However, 1.6 introduced golden animal crackers, which shake things up a bit. Golden animal crackers doubles the production of any animal *except pigs*. So does this change anything? The answer is... nope! Pigs are just that good! Truffle sluts for life!\n\n[Here's basically the gist of the math](https://i.imgur.com/0j5kcS3.png) (each value being the avg daily profit).

Pigs actually need outdoor space to work - quite a lot of it if you want them operating at maximum capacity. In the space you need for 1 barn of pigs to operate efficiently, you could have 2 barns of Sheep or Ostriches and just feed them with hay. And for a serious, endgame income-maximising farm, this matters quite a lot. Farm space is precious, and Pigs use basically twice as much of it as other animals.\n\nOn top of this, you need to manually harvest all the truffles every single evening to get full value, because you can't use autograbbers for them. This puts them in a similar category to Hops, which almost nobody bothers with despite its technical superiority to Ancient Fruit or Starfruit. Wool and Eggs are also daily, but they work with autograbbers, which greatly improves harvest time as well as effectively removing any penalty for skipping a few days here and there, although it will increase the amount of processing needed the day after the skip. Ostriches are particularly nice though as you can safely leave them for harvest once a week *with* autograbbers.", "Why are you assuming 1 wool per 3 days for an end-game sheep?

Seemed like a good idea at the time!", "You surprisingly don't need a whole lot of barns to rush to perfection. I'm not home to do the math rn, but you can get about 150k/day with 4 barns of pigs. With wine production on ginger Island, you don't really need more barns to rush to perfection. As for the effort needed to actually harvest and produce all the truffle oil, it is more effort. It basically becomes a 12k/day tradeoff (per barn). I'm willing to sacrifice that to have all my happy pigs, but I understand others willing to just stick to ostriches and sheep.", "Oh woops I misread the wiki on that one. [Here's an updated table](https://i.imgur.com/ttEon75.png) that reflects the change in mood calculation and different amounts of wool with and without shepherd. The result stays the same, but sheep are now better with rancher than artisan and become the 3rd best animal overall.", "Are you considering that one wool can produce two cloths?", "Yes, that's why the quality multiplier for sheep is different than the one for ostriches. Ostrich mayo quality depends on the quality of the ostrich egg, while the amount of cloth you get depends on the quality of the wool with a different expected value."]},

I googled tips and tricks and nothing is working! I\u2019m trying to avoid using 100 staircases because that\u2019s just an absurd amount of stone to collect for one just one quest, stone that I could use for so many other things that aren\u2019t just single use!

And how many tries did it take you? \n\n(The only pro to all of this is that I have like 10 prismatic shards now which is insane but like idek what to even use them for besides the galaxy sword and donation to the museum lmao) ", "score": 1, "upvote_ratio": 0.6, "created_utc": 1714621191.0, "num_comments": 16, "comments": ["Collect all of your jade and put them in crystalatiums, on Sundays you can trade jade for staircases at the desert trader so you don\u2019t have to waste your stone!", "1.

Go on days with really good luck. Regardless of if you are using staircases or not. If you want to do it without staircases there are a few tricks. \n\n1 - explosive ammo\n2 - ALWAYS take chutes\n3 - kill enemies over tiles that can spawn staircases if you can help it. For example don\u2019t kill serpents while they\u2019re inside a wall. \n4 - break stones in treasure floors. You have a high chance to find another \u201cladder\u201d that can actually spawn as a chute 20% of the time. \n5 - stack speed bonuses from food and drinks. If you can get your hands on a statue of blessings, it can also give you .5 speed. Same with the new books.\nIf you want more tips just reply to me because this is getting long lmao", "Go down a pit or stair as soon as it appears.

Lucky lunches stacked with ginger ale is my go to. That's 4 extra luck right there which is huge. You'll need 2 of each for the whole day if you go early with a totem. \n\nAnother thing I noticed, is if a ladder spawned naturally already, breaking stones won't ever reveal another one, so if you're not seeing a ladder to the next level within 15 seconds, check the rest of the floor for one already there. If you see a ladder, use it asap. Do not waste time getting ores or gems. Your goal is to go deeper, not collect anything. I do this when I'm farming auto petters since the only thing that matters is treasure rooms. My current record is 487 doing this. You got this!", "- crystalariums for jade buys lots of staircases from the desert trader on Sunday. I used about 30 on my first run, but 100 makes it a sure thing. \n- Rubies buy spicy eel. \n- 3 Omni geodes buys a desert warp totem, and that gives you more time. (Just take 1 to use so it's not filling inventory slots)\n- you can with a fish pond and a couple of garden pots always have the ingredients for a lucky lunch available. \n- your first Prismatic Shard should be taken to the pillars in the desert, which will make it easier.\n- bombs to clear floors fast. Bomb if there's enough rocks, staircase if not. \n- don't get distracted by iridium nodes. On your first dive they look tempting, but there will be time enough after you get to 100 and there will be higher density of ore the deeper you get. \n- don't get distracted by monsters. Only fight the ones you must. \n- >!Trinkets in 1.6 give you options for \"crowd control\" which makes it considerably easier to not get overrun. E.g. magic quiver, ice rod.!<\n- you can buy both elixir and bombs from the dwarf. They look expensive, but a bombed floor can easily pay for itself. You can also buy essences from Krobus and likely have plenty of gold ores spare to make your own. \n- >!1.6 also made manufacturing elixir a load easier with mushroom logs!<\n- cheese works pretty well as healing food though, if you have a steady supply. \n- berries look tempting, but don't really heal fast enough when your health is low and a serpent is coming. They're ok for staying topped up out of combat though. \n- put your primary items on easy hotkeys. I usually have 1,2,3,4,5 as sword, pickaxe, bombs, staircase, cheese. \n- falling asleep only costs gold, you don't lose items. But maybe a single farm warp totem is the way to go anyway. \n- you lose items if you run out of health, but this is reduced by luck. And you went on a high luck day with lots of buffs. Marlon can recover one stack for you - but only one. But often enough I don't lose any, or only one I care about, so it's still a good deal. \n- empty your inventory before you go, and then the worst case loss is \"some of your profit\"\n- drinks stack with food. Triple espresso initially, ginger Ale when you have acquired the recipe. \n- that one magic rock candy you got from the museum eventually might be worth using. (It looks expensive, but it does a lot.)\n- rings from adventurer's guild quests are potent. Crab shell boosts your endurance quite significantly. Burglar's ring increases your haul of loot.\n- luck rings if you have them also help with finding ladders and loot.", "Absurd amount of stone to collect???

Keep your hp full all the time. It\u2019s better to waste a little food than to get clobbered and panic.

After you place a bomb, pause the game right when it detonates. Items can still be sucked up to your inventory while you\u2019re paused, but the game time won\u2019t keep going. Every second you can save matters. Plan on passing out at 2am for your best chance. It\u2019ll cost some gold but the extra 2 hours make a BIG difference. That\u2019s all I can think of for now.

The quest always ends at the end of the season, so if it appears late in the season it's not worth trying for.

You will get back almost as much as you spent. (might need to double check my maths on that one)  \n  \nQi's Kindness - very doable as long as you've been collecting loved gifts throughout the game. You need to devote the week to it though.  \n  \nExtended Family - should be doable but I never take it because the gem rewards aren't high enough for the effort imo.  \n  \nQi's Prismatic Grange - this one can be the easiest if you've been saving certain items.  \nSalmonberries for red  \nBlackberries for blue  \nCopper ore for orange  \nHay for yellow  \nFiber for green.  \nThe only truly tricky one for me is purple. Sometimes I have enough void essence but if not it's tough.   \nIf you use the Dyeing page of the Stardew wiki you can see what options you have for each colour.  \n  \nDanger in the Deep - this one needs your full attention for the week, but it's definitely do-able.

Bear with me...\n\n  \nFirst of all, I love this new update. There is so much to explore!! I have one other save file on my switch that I've been playing since launch so I feel like I'm playing a completely new game because I don't remember many of the early cut scenes. I started 1.6 on my Mac about 2 weeks ago and am now on Spring Year 2. \n\nAlright, let's talk >!Desert Festival!< \n\nSo many things to love: the vendors, the activities, the villagers, the dialogue with the festival people (>! like the chef guy, the trivia guy, the race guy, the cactus guy, even the new clothes from Emily <! ) \n\nTiming of the festival could have been a bit more improved. I unknowingly made the mistake of taking on a 2 day villager request the day before the festival, which didn't end up getting completed, sorry Evelyn. The morning of the festival, I also woke up to Living with the Land telling me it was Salmonberry season, which is THE best time of year to forage. I figure - alright I'll do a few farm chores and errands before heading to the festival. Don't do that - once the bus is ready, go straight to it, don't waste your time doing other things. Even with 3 days of festival, I felt like there was so much to do that I should neglect whatever else I was working on.\n\n  \nAnother mistake I made - I typically put a chest outside of the Skull Cavern so I don't have to keep lugging food, bombs, etc home and back for my cave runs. I also put excess tools like my watering can, fishing pole, and scythe in it so I have more backpack space then grab them again before I head home. Well since the desert is now filled with the festival, my chest has disappeared with all the contents in it. I can live without the bombs (I came to terms with the fact that I couldn't speed run), but my fishing pole was pretty crucial for some of the festival activities. \n\nIt was clear from the beginning that I needed to collect >! Calico Eggs, or what I've called Desert Beans  !< . It looks like the top ways to collect were >! fishing and mining !< . So day 1 I found myself at 1:30pm in the afternoon totally unprepared. Whatever, bad days happen, you keep playing. \n\nI wake up for day 2 - the spirts are displeased and I have bad luck again...great. At least with Day 2, I know what I need to do. So I head out and do what I need to do around the festival vendors. As part of this, I talk to >! that guy sitting by the oasis who can change the results of the race !< and make my bet on who I think will win. The race before me was still ending (the timing is just strange) so I walked away and started mining. Well... I died in the mine, which happens. I do like how >! it brings you back to the desert instead of Harvey's house and the gourmet chef basically heals you !< . At this point I'm annoyed but tolerable so I go do my rounds again and go back to see the race results. Then boom....my game crashes so I lose every single item I just bought or mined :( \n\n  \nOverall I do love the festival but I'm a bit bummed with my luck and how things just didn't quite work out. But it's Stardew... and at the end of the day, it's not really a big deal, bad days happen. So I'll take a break, come back, and try it again. (Or maybe skip the festival completely year 2 out of spite haha) And as I get to the festival next year, I'll create a better strategy in preparation. \n\nDoes anyone else have a similar experience?

The overlap with Salmonberry season is making a dent in my usual mining food.\n\n\nIf you haven't already, you can put your chest inside the SC lobby. That map doesn't change with the festival.\n\n\nOverall I think I will enjoy the festival more in late-game, when my days aren't so occupied with the million other things I have to do. But I did enjoy using the >!Chef's Rumpled Fruit Skin!< to have 3 speed boosts and 2 Luck boosts, which I'm pretty sure helped me win big in the Casino and get 3 Stardrops in\u00a0Slots.

I know the Wilderness has more farming space than Meadowland (and maybe even Forest?), but I feel like the other two feels so much cozier so I tend to lean into those two."]},

During the concert (closer to the end of it) some asshole stole the tote bag with the merch we had bought inside it. I know it was on us (we put the tote under the seat while enjoying the music and did not notice the \"swiping\"), but it still baffles me how horrible people can be sometimes.

They potentially have cash to spend on souveniers to help make sure they don't overspend. etc.\n\nI read A LOT. It is honestly amazing the odds and ends you can learn that way.

Any good books you would recommend?", "Hmmm... I will skip things like Harry Potter and Percy Jackson, since they are new enough I'm sure you've been recommended them before. Also, since you are a teen, i will warn that some of these have mature content that is disturbing. It isn't the focus, for the most part, but some scenes are very questionable, especially since a lot of it was written ages ago. Others are just disturbing. But the stories are very good. \n\nThe entire Valdemar/Velgarth Series (and pretty much anything else by Mercedes Lackey. I have yet to find a single thing to read by her I disliked, tho I like some a lot more than others)\n\nThe Pern series, particularly the original ones (the one's by her son are different. It is a science fantasy series, Anne's books lean more into the fantasy side, whereas last I checked, her son leans more into the science side. They are not bad, just a different feel). And again, pretty much anything else by her that I remember reading is worth a look.\n\nXanth and the Incarnations of Immortality by Piers Anthony. Very very different series, so if you don't like one give the other a chance still. IF and ONLY IF your mental health is fairly stable, the Mode series is also good. However, the main character of that one is a suicidal teen girl, and honestly while I loved the books, I still as a 37 year old have some trouble with some of the scenes in it that I read as a suicidal teen girl. If you trust your parents to know if it is too much for you I would actually suggest asking one of them to read it first and decide. Ill be honest, I would NOT allow my 16 year old with mental health issues to read it. I am only mentioning it because I mentioned other series by the same author and felt like I should give warning about this one.\n\nthe M.Y.T.H series by Robert Asprin. \n\nThe Shannara series by Terry Brooks. This one is a fairly dense read, so if you prefer lighter stuff you might not enjoy it, but if you do like denser reads, it is wonderful.\n\nThe Landover series, also by Terry Brooks. VERY different from Shannara. Much easier read. Not as good in my opinion, but still good.\n\nThe wheel of time by Jordan (and Sanderson, who finished the series from Jordan's notes after he died). This is another dense read, but very good. Tho I admit, I haven't read Sanderson's books from it. Not for any valid reason, just stubbornness lol.\n\nSpeaking of Sanderson, and in a VERY different vein from everything else I suggested, the Skyward series is incredible, at least as an audiobook. My whole family loves it, from my 8 year old to my 43 year old husband. Not only is the story wonderful, but the narrator is incredible. Some minor issues in how she inflects a few sentences here or there, but you probably wont notice until you've listened several times anyway.\n\nThe Sword of Truth series by Terry Goodkind. \n\nCamulod Chronicles by Jack Whyte. Very good, Very dense, and with adult situations iirc. Might want to wait a few years for this one, but if you love Aurthurian or Historical fiction, you might really enjoy it even now.\n\nOn a lighter side of Aurthurian stories, The Lost Years of Merlin. I think it is meant for kids, but I still love it anyway.\n\nBack to science fantasy, the Darkover series by Marion Zimmer Bradley is one I used to love, tho I haven't gotten my hands on them in a while...

I think it's nice that there's romance options for all ages, teens like Abigale and Alex through grownups like Leah, Harvey and Shane! But it does make for some alternating icky and funny situations.", "I know what you mean. I\u2019m 44 and every play through I just move Krobus in. I tried marrying Harvey once but it didn\u2019t work out. \n\nI wish we could romance the wizard or Gus. Gus is such a sweethearted man", "I'm 19, been playing since I was like 16. I feel similar. I love the younger ones. I've romanced Seb and Hailey, tried Abigail and Maru. No intrest in Sam. I've also tried Elliot, Emily, and Leah and idk tbh. I have the opposite problem, they feel a bit old to me. It's almost boring bc they have more \"grown up\" lines and reactions. It isn't relatable\n\nAll time fave is Sebastian so far, truly speaking to my age", "I think this is why I tend to gravitate towards Harvey", "No, I\u2019m totally with you. \n\nI also feel bad romancing the ones who really want to get out of the valley. I want them to spread their wings! lol\nI married Shane and he seems happy - he doesn\u2019t have to work at Joja mart any more, he has lots of chickens, and he\u2019s still close to Marnie and Jas", "I\u2019m old enough to be OPs dad, and it feels REALLY off dating these kids. Thankfully, SVE has Olivia, but I\u2019m not aware of a male version of her.", "I see this sentiment a lot and it makes me wonder - are you all just playing as yourself? When I start a new save I always invent a new character with their own personality and backstory and I adjust my idea of their age according to the bachelor they romance. I've never felt creepy about romancing them bc my character is their age", "Sam get taken to his Dr's appointment by his mom..I'm not romancing him. But I am a Harvey's wife for life anyway. unless they give a person of color who is sweet.", "No. I don't identify as the character. It's more like playing with dolls to me. The main character should date and marry somebody I see as their age, not mine.\u00a0", "You can do it or not do it...\u00a0 you can also play as your real age or not.\u00a0 As far as I am aware there is no mention of the player character's age.\u00a0 Only that they are beaten down by life.", "I gave CA the benefit of the doubt that the farmer is around the same age as the youngest romanceable character, and that since you can marry them, that theyre all over the age of consent. I always picture maru sam seb and abby to be college age to late twenties, and by my interpretation I think Haley is the youngest dateable character. Emily leah and shane i interpret to be in their 30s, and Harvey to be around 40. Just my headcanons/interpretations though. \n\nI'm 23 and i relate a lot to the band trio in their level of maturity. I think some older adults forget what young adults are really like lol, especially gen zs (which the trio def gives gen z vibes imo)", "Never really been an issue for me, but aren't there mods that make the younger options look and act older? Sebastian always seemed like he was very late 20s to me for some reason.", "Nah. I imagine them as the same age as my character. I have to pretty much assume they're way way different than me because my character is actually willing to date and marry someone In real life? I have neither the time nor the interest in dating anyone. \n\nThough people's definition of age gap is getting smaller...", "Yeah, Sam and Alex feel too young for me. (I\u2019m 30.) Sebastian seems a little older to me for some reason. Maybe I relate to him because I\u2019m also a software developer who, until fairly recently, lived with my parents. And he\u2019s canonically older than Maru, at least. \n\nSam\u2019s 10-heart event felt super weird to me. I can understand living with your parents as an adult, but literally sneaking in through the window felt very teenager-y. How about we go meet literally anywhere else instead, Sam?", "The only one that really bothers me is Sam. It feels like the others could be any age between 20 and 30, but Sam looks and acts like a teenager who's still in high school. He's the only bachelor I've never even considered marrying because his personality is so unattractive. Either he is a literal teenager, in which case I'm not interested; or he's an adult who thinks he's a teenager, in which case I'm still not interested. \n\nAlex and Seb sort of act like many people my age - those of us who are in our 30s but still trying to just get by in life. They may still be stuck a bit in the past, but they still are very aware that they're adults. Their dialogue is so similar to things I've thought myself - questioning whether I'm holding on to things I shouldn't, and wondering when I'm going to finally become \"successful\", and discovering more about myself every day. Alex's entire storyline is that of a guy who peaked in high school and can't let go of the glory days. Seb is the basement dweller who hasn't really found his stride. They're very relatable to me personally. \n\nWith Sam, it's like he just... is a kid. He doesn't fret too much about growing up. He's happy to sneak you into his room because \"teehee, we don't wanna get caught!\" He doesn't care about saving money. \n\nThat said, I think that purity culture in fandom is starting to go too far. People are beginning to judge others for which video game characters they like, and that is kinda sick. It's fantasy, so go ahead and marry Sam if you want to. He's not a child, he's at least 18, and he's a bunch of pixels. If he's the one you like, go for it. I know some people who say that marrying Sam or Abigail makes you tantamount to a kiddy diddler, and that's absolutely freaking ridiculous.", "I meannnn I'm 20 going on 21 soon, and I prefer the older characters like Shane", "I am 45+ and I have no problem dating any of the candidates, cough except Elliot he disgust\u2019s me,reminds me way too much of Fabio whom I have always thought was disgusting, the way I think about it is it\u2019s not me as I am now my character represents a younger, more beautiful, full of life me, who is totally and completely young enough for the characters.", "I haven't done the dating stuff in a few years but it's very believable to me that the dateable characters in Stardew Valley can be within the appropriate age range of at the very least most millennials, though one or two give kinda early 20s vibes.  \n  \nIn my mind, Stardew Valley is an aging small rural town with a weak economy and brutal zoning, as many small towns tend to have. Heard of single family zoning? Agricultural zoning is so, so much worse. The land may be cheaper but you need so much more of it to be able to build a house, so the baseline cost can be comparable to building closer to or even in some cities, while the weak small town economy ensures that younger generations will largely be stuck living with their parents well into adulthood.", "Nah, age gaps have never been an issue for me, but that's cause I was pursuing 40 year old men in my 20s.", "Yeah, I'm an adult. There is nothing less appealing to me than a teenage boy like Sebastian or Sam. I married Harvey because he's obviously old enough to have gone to medical school. Plus he's a sweetie-pie.", "opposite. just turned 18, married penny and i feel like i married a cougar sometimes. she talks about how she teaches all the kids in the town and im like... girl when are classes cause i dont have my diploma yet", "I very much feel I\u2019m embodying the experience of my character; I have two saves and I\u2019ve created them both as very different people. Alice is married to Leah and Kellan is married to Abigail. They\u2019re living completely different lives.", "First serious playthrough, absolutely. But then again, I had my heart set on Emily pretty early on, to the point that I didn\u2019t ever bother romancing anyone else.\n\nEvery save since, I don\u2019t play as \u201cme\u201d but roleplay as someone typically younger, and more often than not differently gendered. And I romance everyone up to ten hearts before proposing lol", "Abigail is young, but she doesn't feel immature. It helps that I'm a massive gamer and gamedev IRL.\n\nSam and Alex don't interest me as partners; neither does Harvey. I guess it's more personality for me.", "Shane definitely passes as a 30something", "Besides maybe Leah and if I stretch it pretty far Emily and Haley, the romance options I'm into make me feel like a cougar. I'm turning thirty soon. I'd love to romance someone a bit older, but the ladies I'd like are Sandy or are taken (Jodie and robin)", "Honestly I have just had Krobus move in every single game. He is best roomie.", "I chose Harvey because I\u2019m attracted to financial stability \ud83d\ude02 which is something I didn\u2019t care about until I hit 25", "I've played this game when I was around 18 or 19, so I don't mind younger partner. Now I'm 26, still feel the same way about them like the first time I played. But then again, I mostly date either Elliott, Doc, Alex or Haley.", "You might be able to find a mod for older NPCs such as willy", "I am 36 but I have gotten all to 10 hearts to unlock all special events. \nI just see it as a possibility to explore (but I also have around 800 hours in the game in total).\n\nTechnically none of them are getting any older and this might all be old and wise ;)", "I just wanna marry Clint, the true dilf aged man. Sad that we cannot so I marry Shane every run \ud83d\ude2d\n\ud83d\ude4f Praying for my fellow Clint lovers to get the ring for our man Clint, we're ready to take him into our sheets ConcernedApe- be surely concerned.", "no bc this is my problem with it too. im a lesbian so i dont want to date harvey or shane or elliot who seem like the older bachelors. \n\ni have an irl sister named leah so leah who is the only female npc i like who doesnt feel like a teen is off the table. the other one being emily but i dont really vibe with emily so im just  .-.", "I absolutely feel this. Its a weird experience to have because the last I played a game like this, I was much younger and I couldn't even think of this being a problem. To revisit a game like this as an adult is so strange. Like to see Sam practicing skateboard tricks in his front yard....that is a child. I really liked Sebastain, but similar issue, the teenage angst just really spoiled things. I can't really suspend my disbelief, because inevitably there's a part of me in the Farmer character, which is the intention of the design and I just can't picture marrying someone fresh out of high-school.\n\nI ended up liking Elliott the best anyway, but I'd love to see some older options in the future. Like 2 or 3 options is nothing. Really I'm just dying for more content in general.", "I can roleplay a younger farmer (my first husband was Sam, which was kinda a teenage crush) but yeah. I feel better with Harvey my love (I'm 39).", "Couldn\u2019t you consider the ones still in uni to be a bit older and having gone back?", "Depends on the game, but in most cases if the game has the option to create a character, I usually end up playing some alternative/idealised version of me, especially on a first-time playthrough. That said, I'm a 37 year old man, who plays female characters whenever I have the option (don't know what that says about me considering what I said earlier), but I kind-of agree.\n\nAt least it would explain, why after working hard to romance Abigail (gave her a bouquet but not married), I've now switched focus to Leah.", "I got over it because I can only play through and marry Emily/Leah so many times before I HAVE to try something else. But yes, I am almost 40 and it has always bothered me under the surface. I just have to tell myself that my farmer is young as well.", "Oh my gosh, more games so need older romance option. Its makes me feel ick with how young they usually make them.", "maru too", "SVE is great because it adds mother and son characters and you can go after either.\n\nAnyway, I agree. Sam is in a league of his own IMO, playing on his Game Boy and getting yelled at for skateboarding.\n\nI just consider the younger options for be \"for\" younger players who'll empathize more with them than the older-coded characters.", "I'm 52 and not at all. The way I think about it, the farmer is not who I am in real life. I imagine, if it is a self-insert I'm thinking about, that it is a version of me that is at most 22 From Another Universe.", "Not at all.\n\nIt's not me in the game. It's the farmer I create. Depending on how I build her character when I start a new farm will depend on who she dates/marries.\n\nI typically know who's going to be the lucky townie before Robin introduces me to the run down farm grandpa left me.", "Yeah I don\u2019t bother with them.", "This is why I haven't been able to play Story of Seasons in 10 years. I'm 35 now. Those characters always look way too young, I hate it.", "It depends how you're role playing the game? Are you yourself a younger farmer or older?\n\nThe game has a (sort of) wide range of ages to cater for various tastes! You don't have to romance those who you don't connect with....", "absolutely, I feel the same - I'm 46 so maybe with even more justice haha. I tend to think of it as a 'life stage' issue as much as anything. The mentality and lifestyle of someone still living at home and not working or just working casually is such a long way away me.", "I hope concerned ape takes note of this for haunted chocolatier", "I\u2019m 17 so i\u2019m not really off put by the younger ones. But sometimes alot of them feel like american highschool students in the movies. Sure there older and adults. But i\u2019ve gotten used to viewing them as highschool students now \ud83d\ude2d \n\nIt always catches me off guard sometimes seeing shane and two little toddlers \ud83d\ude02", "Not particularly. My farmers aren\u2019t me, my farmers are characters I made up with motives, interests, traits, ages etc that don\u2019t necessarily align with mine. I don\u2019t (consciously - unconsciously it\u2019s probably inevitable) self-insert much generally with games. I make up a character and try to act as they would.", "I always end up with Elliott. Who\u2019s one of the older bachelors. But I do keep Sam as my side-piece in my current save file.", "I role-play when playing the game, sk I'm not playing as ME, I'm roleplaying as my little farmer character. So to answer your question, no. I don't feel weird romancing the younger singles in Stardew Valley", "Yeah, I started playing when I was 35 and felt the same. It's why I married Leah, she seems to be one of the older bachelorettes.", "They all say they want to leave the town and move to the city, so it puts me off marrying them because then they\u2019re trapped in this small town with me.", "There is no way I could date haley or maru, they feel so young. Even in my last run I settled for Eliott for age reasons", "It didn't bother me when I first started playing at 22/23, but not that I'm 28, some of the dateables just feel a bit immature. Sam, Abigailand Penny in particular feel too young for me. I usually go for Leah, Elliot or Harvey these days.\n\n I get why CA made most the romanceable characters in the late teens to mid thirties bracket, but I do think it'd be nice to have some older NPCs to date\n\nPart of why I like Stardew Valley Expanded so much is because there's older NPCs available. Olivia must be at least in her forties, given Victor, her son, has a college degree. Even if she had him at 16, that puts her at 38 minimum, and she doesn't strike me as the teen mum type", "This is why I frequently marry Shane or Harvey and definitely not because I have that \u201cI can fix him\u201d mentality \ud83d\ude05", "I feel off marrying older candidates like Harvey and Shane bc I\u2019m younger than they are so I get what you mean\nI tried it one time with Shane because I liked his storyline/blue chickens the first time around but when you marry him he relapses also which is just sad lol\nI don\u2019t know why they added that into game because now it\u2019s just another character who\u2019s life I feel like I\u2019m ruining by marrying them \ud83d\ude2d", "nope i am the same way. thankfully with mods such as SVE and ridgeside village there is more options (Olivia for SVE is a personal favorite)", "a little bit bc they act like highschoolers \ud83d\ude2d but i\u2019m 20 so ill be fine for like 3 years then ill move on to harvey", "Same. They just seem too High School for me, personally.", "Depends on how old you are I guess *shrug* \nI started playing harvest moon - like games when I was like... 10. I'm 26 now. \nWhen I was a kid I would not dye older bachelor's because yikes, now I feel icky with the ones that look 15-16. I'm still okay with Sam and Sebastian because in my mind they are like 23 (even if in the game they might be younger canonically) but I think at some point those guys will become icky to me too", "No because it's a farming Sim not real life. I mean, if they looked like 12 year olds I'd be weirded out by it, but otherwise nah.", "I'm mid 40's and my farmer is definitely a self-insert, but I also see it as a way to make up for lost time so to speak (put it this way, there's a reason I relate to the depressed characters..) - and I always go for Sebastian because in a lot of ways we're very similar; we're both coders and nerds, just for starters.\n\nI did marry Sam in another save, and have to agree with others that it feels wrong: he still visits family, but when you first talk to Vincent after the wedding he's like \"don't take my brother away!\" \ud83e\udd7a Whereas Seb is so happy to be out of that house and with someone who truly appreciates him \ud83e\udd79", "I married Leah my first time because she seems like she\u2019s in her mid 20s at least, like she has a House!! It was great and i honestly really liked her. I don\u2019t think i could ever romance Sam l, but for a while I also avoided Alex due the same reason and now I\u2019m married to him. I can imagine it feels less weird to me than to you because I\u2019m just 20, but still. Some of them feel like they\u2019re still in high school. Alex looks and is kinda similar to my bf which is why I married him, so now he feels like less of a high schooler to me and more like a college frat guy which i\u2019m fine with.\n\nIf i had to rank to characters on youngest to oldest I feel like it\u2019d be Sam, Abigail, Alex, then Sebastian (bro has a WFH job\ud83d\ude4f)", "Yes \ud83d\ude39 Maru, Sam and Abbie have wayyyyy more growing up to do.", "I don't view the farmer as \"me\", but I do feel icky romancing the younger marriage candidates...\n\nBut I don't consider Sebastian as young as the others.

Cannot marry those who live with their parents still.", "I married Sam and I feel like I mase a mistake lol. I'm 30 and it just feels wrong xD", "Agree, I've always felt that there should be a better range of older romanceables. Ngl I've always had a thing for Willy. Let me date him!!", "Yes! I felt the same way! So instead I decided to look at from the perspective of my younger days in my 20\u2019s. I\u2019m going for Sam because he reminds me so much of my husband when we first met. Once I thought of it that way, I didn\u2019t feel icky anymore.", "Nah. All the characters are supposedly out of high school and my head canon is that your character, the farmer, just realized what an absolute hellhole corporate life is like and is like 20ish.\n\nFor instance, in Persona 5, the MC is only like 17(?) so I don\u2019t mind dating one of the characters his own age. I do take issue with the fact some romanceable women are in their mid 20s or early 30s, so I steer clear of that.", "i got SVE for this very reason lol. when i see sam seb and alex i think \"babies...theyre babies\" and get ick. then i found out SVE makes rasmodius romancable. immediate win for me. for reference i am only 24(f) XD.", "I felt the same way when I first played because I like to imagine characters similar to myself when I make them (for the first go).", "I was 21 when I started playing so I have the opposite perspective but I do feel you. If something feels weird to you there is nothing wrong with just not doing it", "I\u2019m in my mid twenties and still studying so I don\u2019t have any issues with their ages but I\u2019ve got to confess that the older bachelors are more appealing to me. Being in your twenties (at least nowadays) feels more like teenager part 2 than adulthood. You study hard, work harder and still can\u2019t get a job and/or afford to leave your parents house and all the younger bachelors and bachelorettes of the game are in this situation. I don\u2019t need a reminder of my own struggles lol\n\nWhen I was a younger I used to daydream that my letter from Hogwarts had been intercepted or something and that Hagrid would knock on my door someday and tell me I\u2019m a witch but now I wish my grandpa would\u2019ve left me a farm so I could at least sell some parsnips for a living :\u2019)", "No, because I don't see the farmer as a version of me, and so I don't consider them my age. They're in whatever age bracket suits whichever partner I want to romance, i.e. older if I intend to romance Harvey, younger if it's Seb or Abigail. I don't feel weird playing a game like Life is Strange just because I'm older than the protagonist either.", "Yeah definitely, Sam would have been my type at like,15, but I\u2019m nearly 33 so I\u2019d like a grown up please haha", "I picked my marriage based on how interesting their room and/or outside area was, so I married Sam lol", "I always felt the exact same. I always only interested in Leah, Emily, Shane and kind of Harvey. All the others feel designed to be 18-21 and for me its way too young. I wish we could have a thing with Jodi and Caroline too", "Who are considered the older bachelors/bachelorettes", "I feel weird romancing Maru cause she looks like a middle schooler to me-", "Not really. I\u2019m only 20 so it\u2019s different though for me though than you.", "I'd strongly suggest trying the expanded farm mod? It has Victor and some pink haired girl ( I can't remember her name) that both don't make me feel like a pedophile to date them. That, and Victor at least doesn't make me feel like I'm ruining his life (unlike Sam/Sebastian) and taking him away from friends. He still goes to work on the bridge.", "That's why I prefer Elliott, Harvey, Shane and Krobus. As for the girls, Haley and Emily.\n\nI am older than you and I feel the same way. But also it is possible to just separate your farmer character from your actual self. If you just play as a younger fictional character not based on yourself irl, then I don't see anything wrong in choosing the younger marriage candidates. It's just a game so you can separate real life from fiction. \n\nBut that said, it still does feel a bit off to choose the younger ones when you hit a certain age. So I highly doubt I'd be able to romance and marry anyone other than the ones I mentioned.", "I\u2019m 35, and the only characters I feel are too young are Maru and Penny. They both feel to me like they\u2019re maybe 18.\n\nAbby, seb and Sam all feel like 22-23. I was 21 when I met my irl husband and I see a lot of similarities. \nSam: I was still living with my mom till 22 and she would also get mad if I dropped food\nAbigail: argues with her mom about being treated like a child despite taking college courses/being an adult\nSebastian: works in IT, I don\u2019t know many folks who do freelance IT that started in their teen years. Usually you need some college or trade school first. \n\nThat\u2019s just my two cents on it", "I sometimes feel that way. When I first started playing when I was a little younger, I was crazy for Sebastian but then I stopped playing for a ling time. I'm now 30 and have picked up the game again but I've found that I like Elliott more now. I still think Sebby is cute though but now Elliott is my fave.", "I mean, its really just up to you. I play each new save file as a new \"character\" and determine their age from there. I started playing when I was around 23-24 and Sam, Seb and Alex are my go-to's for marriage candidates. If you don't want to, its ok. I know some people who marry Shane no matter what, since they feel most comfortable with that. (He's always been just an Uncle figure for me though)", "I do. I always play as myself, using my irl first name as character name. I haven't tried romance in SV for several reasons, but one certainly is that I turn fifty next year, and I feel most of the bachelors around town are the same age as my kids, who are both young adults. Even Harvey feels like somewhere in age between my kids and myself, and far too young for me really.", "I'm 41 and feel quite the same way. The only ones I marry is Leah and Elliot because I feel like they would be closer to my age while the rest of them (sans Harvey) feel like they're in the early 20s and far to young for me. I only married them once when I used a poly mod and decided to marry every single bachelor/ettes.", "Sebastian is still my guy, but as of late, I've been gravitating towards Shane (thank the Lord for mods supporting his sobriety) and part of it is indeed that it feels a little weird how emo teen Sebastian feels. \n\nCuz he is definitely a grown man, not a teenager. Yet the vibe is palpable.", "Yeah I get that. One thing in particular that got me was that I thought Sebastian(my husband) was early twenties but his mom, Robin, looks like she could also be early twenties. Im guessing she\u2019s older though. I think how the characters look is meant to be more ambiguous as to not be specific about age. But definitely some of them seem young.", "Yup. I only romance Harvey, Elliott, Leah, and Emily because of that", "i'm on a playthrough for the first time in a few years and i used to be diehard abigail but it felt off this time for the same reason, ended up getting married to leah", "I honestly worry a little cuz I currently really like seb but I'm worried when I get older I won't be able to enjoy him anymore for some reason. Like not cuz anyone will judge me or anything, just cuz future me might feel weird about it lol", "Not really a problem for me. It's a roleplaying game, so I just roleplay as my character who is a young guy who's first gig was Joja Corp, so he's roughly the same age as them. \n\nI roleplay in pretty much any game that it's possible to get more immersed. If I play D&D or Pathfinder, I'm not actually an elf. When playing Red Dead Redemption, I AM Arthur Morgan in my head. If I didn't play like this, I'd connect with very few games.", "I\u2019m about to me 22 so I\u2019m probably in the age range they\u2019re in, but ffs I can\u2019t stand Sam more out of all of them. He\u2019s like a child more than the rest.", "I feel this way about Sam and Alex, but Seb always felt more mature to me. He has a proper job as a programmer, is saving up money and has plans. Other than the kind of \"emo\" aesthetic, I wouldn't know he was that young except that he hangs out with Abigail and Sam.\n\nIt seems to me that Concerned Ape created a variety of options for exactly this reason, that people could match themselves with a person who felt like the same age as them. It's good to remember that the audience for gaming skews younger, which is why most of the options are also younger. The player character is also seemingly pretty young.", "Yeah, i feel the same! I'm a bit older than you, and even if my farmer doesn't have to be exactly my age, I feel like they are at least thirty if they had to work long enough for joja to feel like they just had to start over completly.\n\nAnd as a thirty year old it feels weird enough dating someone like Seb, who is pretty young and still lives with his Mom, but at least he's working a job already. Sam and Alex feel like they have just now graduated, I mean it seems like they don't even know what they'll be doing now with their lives. Abigail seems to at least have a plan and is in college, so that doesn't feel quite as bad to me, especcially when compared to the immaturity of both boys.\n\nI ended up going for Leah and Elliot, and settled down with Elliot last time. I would like to try dating someone else next time, but to be honest, I might well end up just marrying Elliot again. \ud83d\ude05", "this is so interesting because i never got that vibe! i started playing when i was 20 and im 23 now so maybe that\u2019s why, but sebastian, abigail, and sam all felt 24-28 to me, especially since i started playing at a weird time when there was the pandemic and i felt kind of \u201cstuck\u201d development wise. now when i play i do read abigail as younger than when i first started playing, but the homework line never threw me because in the community im from its pretty common for people to take breaks from college to work or start families before going back, and since pelican town is such a small community i thought it could be the same. the egg thing and hiding in sam\u2019s room is definitely kinda odd lol, but i had overprotective parents too so it didn\u2019t immediately weird me out. but i might feel differently in a few years since my perspective has already changed, so we\u2019ll see!", "That's immersion for you and how you know CA has done well to really pull you into the game. When you start projecting yourself in the position of a character to the point that moral choices in a game feel wrong due to your *real* morals, that's how you know you're sucked in.", "Same here. I\u2019m 33, and have never married Abigail or Sam. Neither of them seem a day over nineteen, which is way too young for me. Sebastian feels a *little* more mature, so he passes my age check by a hair. He\u2019s canonically older than Maru, who is at least old enough to have a nursing degree. My age test is that anyone young enough to participate in the Egg Hunt is off my radar.", "Maybe this is still too young for you, but I always figured Sebastian was ~mid 20s and just happens to be friends with Sam and Abigail who are younger as they're the only ones into music/d&d.\n\nThere's a specific cutscene with him where he talks about his job as a programmer, that's why he's on his PC in his room all day. So I figure he's post-college age at least!", "Yes, I just turned 58 and I  just can't marry some of the younger candidates.", "Me too, I've been playing basically since the game came out but the younger bachelors/bachelorettes feel like teenagers. Harvey and Elliott are my go-to's bc they seem to have established careers and experience in a way the younger ones do not", "Yes, I was feeling Sam until he hid me in his room so his mother wouldn\u2019t find out I was there, like bro I\u2019m a grown ass woman \ud83e\udd23", "At 58 I see the marriage candidates as children. Probably not going to pursue that aspect of the game.", "I've had these same feelings and discussed it with my two teens. Straight up told them the ones who live with their parents feel too young for me. I've married Leah, Emily, and Elliott. The only exception is Alex. I think it's because he reminds me of unresolved feelings for this guy I had a huge crush on in high school.\u00a0 Plus...Alex might be older and live with his grandparents to help them. Or so I like to tell myself.\u00a0", "It definitely feels weird to me. I always go for Leah. Sadly Robin isn't available, she'd be perfect. If I ever end up playing as a guy I would consider Elliot or Harvey, I feel like they're both in their late 20's/ early 30's. The younger ones seem to be just out of school, barely adults.", "I\u2019m a younger player, and the younger npcs have the opposite effect on me.

Or they at least like the Valley life style. Maybe not Shane, but he needs to get off the sauce. \n\nHaving romanced everyone at least once, I do feel more weirded out by romancing the younger folk.

Abigail, Maru, and Sam seem like children 100%", "Tbh I wasn't ever interested in dating any of the younger bachelor/ettes even when I was closer to their age. They just seemed so immature and since I solely play as female Alex and Sam rubbed me the wrong way. \n\nAbigail is cool but I always saw her as some sort of a sister or friend more than a lover. Sebastian is probably the only one I would consider dating but his lifestyle doesn't align with my vision of my play. \n\nMost of the time I go for Harvey since he's the most sane and actually does something even when you marry him.", "I was surprised when I learned they are romanceable! I thought they were just kids lol", "Yeah...I have a decade plus on you, and some of the parents in the game feel young to me, let alone the kids.

In small towns plenty of ppl still live with their families and live pretty juvenile lifestyles because there's less rush out in the rural areas compared to city living.\n\nThat said, they do annoy me at times and give me similar feelings, even being 24 myself. Particularly Sam, who I loved at first and only clocked around 22 or 23 minimum. I grew to realize, though, that he was every early-20s-dude who takes advantage of his mom. After becoming better friends with Jodi, it appalled me that he never considered her. He seems content freeloading, and that's behaviorally immature enough for me to divorce his ass. The immaturity is more in his behavior than whatever age range he's a part of. Same with Abigail, I feel like.\n\nSebastian, I have a similar vibe about, but he's employed and just directionless. It takes time to develop decent coding skills (i used to code for a living so i know, lol) enough to freelance, so I never really saw him younger than 22. I do think he's more around 28, personally, just based on his career as a freelancer which appears established (hard to do without a built rapport) and how he reacts to the Maru situation. He's come to terms with it despite admitting struggling with it as a kid - something tells me he'd be more high strung on it if he were any younger than late 20s, because that's not just something I see someone swallowing that easy if it's a deep seeded family issue. He just seems like your average lost 20-something trying to figure out \"now what?\"\n\nAbigail also struck me about early 20's, no younger than 21. She's not far off from most late bloomer small town girls in terms of personality or life direction. I had plenty of friends take many years to decide on college and then finish it. In my experience, most rural kids go to school online or part time if they don't leave their hometowns, which can take longer to complete. I assumed she was just like that, I guess.\n\nI don't think they're fresh out of high school or any younger than your typical college grad age. I think they're your average late-to-college or late-to-direction young adults you see all over rural towns. And, because there's less pressure to grow up in rural communities, many people can just... choose not to. Or, they get stuck in a phase of life, and despite wanting to \"grow up,\" lack the ability to due to their environment. I was one of them too despite finishing college on time, so perhaps it's that empathy with them that makes them seem not THAT young to me.\n\nThat said, I'd probably feel weird about it if I were 30 or 40, yeah. Or if my brain clocked them more around 18-20, I'd be totally disinterested. I always go endgame for Shane or Haley anyway, occasionally Sebastian, so it's not too much of an issue to me.", "Harvest moon and rune factory games are even worse", "Its no worse than Luna from Harvest Moon Tree of Tranquility.

They are on their own mentally, like they just got out of high school and believe they are on top of the world. They have those that care about them, but they aren't effected to much by them. They have their dreams, and are blinded to anything else. Emily may have an argument about chores with her sister, otherwise she is on about herself.\n\nAbigail, and Penny feel early to mid twenties. Abby is in college, but her parents don't see that and treat her as a kid. While Penny is a hard debate on her age. She is more mature but also naive. She may be smart but she needs to wisen up.\n\nSebastian, Shane, and Emily are definitely mid to late 20s. They all have jobs and are responsible. They live their lives and had some experience. Shane may not be as responsible, but mental health issues will do that. Seb could be younger, but the fact they he gets annoyed cause the rest don't see what he does as work makes him older.\n\nHarvey, Elliot, and Leah seem the oldest. They all aren't from around here, they all live on their own, and they all have already made moves into their ambitions. Harvey is a licensed medical practitioner, which takes time.

Haley seems kinda like Abigail's age whereas Emily seems older than Sebastian but maybe not as old as Leah.

I still date Sam adn Abigail because i'm a completionist and have to get everyone at 10 hearts, but they're not the ones I marry, or date in non-main saves lol. \n\nI think the point is variety. They might seem too young for some of us, but for players who are in their late teens/early 20's they might be more relatable..\n\nThe vanilla game definitely needs some more older candidates though.", "Agreed. I've never felt comfortable going for Sam and Abigail, especially due to their parent interactions. Alex I can see as the college-aged-but-didn't-go-to-college former jock and even though I haven't gone for him, I could see it working.

The degree would have taken 3-4 years and I assume the farmer has worked for joja for a couple of years. 18+3+2 = 23 So, 23 feels like the most likely age to me but I guess the farmer could've quit the job in a few months.

Honestly, I think it's fine to continue the save but just remember to choose to cut your own trees and mine your own ores from now because it shouldn't really cost you money to get those resources. This game's best perk is that it doesn't really have a super exact deadline so you're free to just adjust now in year 2. Like, there's always a way to finish things.\n\nHowever, I also do feel like 1 in-game year is short enough that it won't feel like a big loss if you do start a new save.\n\nAlso, I think it would benefit you to read through the Stardew Valley Wiki as well as use the [Stardew Profits](https://thorinair.github.io/Stardew-Profits/#produce_0-equipment_0-sellRaw_false-aging_0-planted_1-maxSeedMoney_0-days_28-fertilizer_0-level_1-season_0-buySeed_false-replant_false-nextyear_false-buyFert_false-average_0-fertilizerSource_0-seeds_(pierre_true-joja_true-special_true)-skills_(till_false-agri_false-arti_false-gatherer_false-botanist_false)-foodIndex_0-foodLevel_0-extra_true-crossSeason_false-foragingLevel_1) as reference from now on. I think these serve as really good guides on what to do, what things/places are there to do/explore, which crops you'd want to grow if you want money, and so on.\n\nIf you have more specific questions, let me know! I'm sure others will also have more in depth tips for you here :)", "You can very easily farm ores by going to the mines and making runs there. I never buy ore/materials to the merchant, and it goes very okey, don't worry about that.", "I never buy ore, or building resources, I gather all of them myself. Ores and stones from the mines (level 1-40 for copper, 41-80 for iron, 81-120 for gold), coal in particular from farming dust sprites in the icy mine levels, wood from just planting trees etc. I am actually rarely short on resources, for most people that only happens when they build huge processing plants, like a shed full of kegs or similar, which I usually don't do.\n\nSo, depending on you play style - the price increases could either not matter at all, encourage you to farm them yourself, or worst case just slow you down a bit. You still are better off with you 2nd year save than starting over - just think of all the things you already managed to do. You almost certainly are able to make much much more money right now than at the start of the game.\n\nMy beginner tips would be similar: Take your time, there is nothing you can miss - everything will be back later. It really does not matter at all how fast you progress.\n\nFor an actual tip: Keep a few of every item you acquire - you will probably have a need for it at some point (for community center bundles, quests, cooking, or whatever), and for seasonal items its amazing if you find you still have it somewhere lying around instead of having to wait until the correct season is back.", "So I read a few comments and OP has a hard time with the mines. For them I\u2018d recommend upgrading the pickaxe and maybe looking for a better weapon/shoes and using buff food. The wiki is very helpful in finding out where to get what you want. I\u2018d recommend to start boosting defense until you get better at this. Defense is a flat dmg reduction and can make monsters trivial. Some healing food is nice, too.\n\nThere is also a place without monsters that spawns ore if you finish a certain room in the community center.  \n\nTime is another matter. I\u2018d say the less other things you do the more time you\u2018d have for the mine. Sometimes it\u2018s nice ignoring everything for a day or two and going full mine. \n\nHaving many sprinklers will make you money fast. And I think for most ppl it\u2018s a flex reaching a late year in this game.", "I\u2019ve been harvesting my own wood and I\u2019ve collected my own copper ore, but I\u2019ve not come across any iron or gold ore in the mines\u2026I\u2019m down to level 20, maybe 25? Haven\u2019t come across any yet, so I figured buying it from Clint was the only way \ud83d\ude48 I assume they\u2019re just farther down in the mines? I\u2019m horrible at combat so I generally die before being able to get much farther than 20+ levels down \ud83d\ude2d \n\nI know this isn\u2019t a speed run type of game unless I make it one, so I guess it\u2019s okay if things take a long time\u2026I just feel like there\u2019s *so much* to this game, so I\u2019m missing out on some things by not having the most efficient farm \ud83d\ude06 \n\nI also just discovered there\u2019s dwarfs, ghosts, and mummies?! Haven\u2019t come across those yet, either \ud83d\udc80 I also just didn\u2019t pay attention to friendships with NPCs for the entirety of Spring and Summer and am now kind of bummed. But there\u2019s only 13 minutes in a day so it\u2019s hard to get everything in!", "I had no idea the mines were so deep \ud83d\ude31 Oh my goodness\u2026that really will take a while \ud83d\ude06 Guess I\u2019m just watering everything by hand until then!", ">I\u2019m horrible at combat so I generally die before being able to get much farther than 20+ levels down \ud83d\ude2d\n\nThere is an elevator every 5 levels in the mines - somewhere on the top border. Once you reach level 5, 10, 15, 20, etc., the next time you enter the mines, you can take the elevator straight to those levels you already reached and continue from there.", "In case you did not know, the mines has an elevator that saves your progress every 5 floors. You don\u00b4t have to start at 0 every time, just take the elevator to the highest floor you unlocked and start from there. You\u00b4ll never get to the bottom otherwise :)", "Yes, so iron ores generally start around level 41 to 79 and gold ores from level 81 to 119. \n\nI get what you mean though! Because you are aware that there's lots of things to accomplish, there's also this pressure to complete them all ASAP or like have milestones every other day or something. But really, it's a step by step thing especially if it's a first playthrough.\n\nWhat helped me with the mining experience was setting aside days just for mining (e.g. I only mine on odd days) so I can focus on just doing that. It also allows me as much time as I need so I can go as far as I can before 2AM. It helps that there are elevators per 5th and 10th floor, so I just try to go down at least 5 levels per day instead of trying to speedrun it to the bottom. Also, I use foraged blackberries and salmonberries (and mushrooms because I chose the mushroom cave) as my food to recover health. The dwarves are friendly NPCs you'll come across once you progress with mining and upgrading your tools. The ghost, mummies, and other monsters you'll see the more you explore the mines.\n\nAs for the NPC relationships, don't worry! In my 1.6 farm I basically became a recluse (lol) and only gave gifts to Caroline (for money earning hack), Marnie (for a quest), and Elliot (because hubby hehe) for almost two years! I really only started paying attention to the others starting Year 3. Plus the villagers won't hold it against you or make any comments if you don't interact with them until later!", "I would recommend you to \"learn\" mining. After you get used to it and get good equipment, you will see the mine in the city is easy.", "Yes I saw that, super helpful to have! I just mean the creatures around 20 end up taking me out before I can progress \ud83d\ude2d I keep good and such on me but with how much time I have to take to stop and fight, then go back to collecting, the darn day is already done and I have to run home lol", "If you've killed the 10 slimes to gain access to the Adventurer's Guild, I'd recommend stop by and see if there is a better weapon than what you currently have. Maybe look at the rings, if you're not already outfitted with an iridium band+one more.\n\n\n\nAlso, if you haven't already, upgrade your pick axe. The deeper you go the more swings of your pick you'll need to break even the basic rocks, never mind the ores. Your first 5 bars of any metal should be dedicated toward upgrading your pick, depending on money and other factors (if it's winter/rainy upgrade the watering can, etc).", "Ah I see. Yeah, the combat can take a while to get used to. What really helps is gear: To the right of the mine is the adventures guild, check if they have a better weapon for sale than the one you currently use, and maybe some nice defensive boots and some rings. Also, bring some food that  heals a good amount (carrots, summer squash, broccoli and powder melon work quite well, as does cheese and hops) and try to top up once your health dips too low.\n\nIt takes some practice to not get overwhelmed, but I'm sure you can do it!"]},

I like efficiency so I like profits with little effort. Honestly in my new rancher save I'm doing zero pigs and enjoying it a lot more. Esp as I start giving my sheep and goats and ostriches animal crackers.", "People constantly redo the math, and even assuming no truffles in winter or on rain days, pigs are still more productive than any other animal by a very wide margin. Even with new 1.6 benefits I don\u2019t think any other creature comes close (although I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ve seen the updated number or not yet, but I think the old numbers were well more than double for pigs, so it should still hold).\n\nThat being said, I hate picking up truffles. Which I have a mod for now, but in the base game I just buy one. Leaving money on the table? Maybe. Saving my sanity? Definitely.", "After 1.6, I have the impression pigs are less efficient. I have one pig, and sometimes, it takes days for it to find a turffle. Or maybe they are just hidden in the blue glass, I don't know.", "A cow (max hearts + cracker) should make you 966g per day (2 golden cheese) \n\nA pig will produce \u22483 truffles per day if it has sufficient space. Mine never seem to come close to 3 but ok wiki. Because pigs need space outside you need to let them out of the barn. Cows can stay inside. Meaning if you care for profit you\u2018d fit 3 cow barns in the same space one pig barn needs. Who needs grass. It won\u2018t produce in winter and during rain. Lets be generous and say it never rains. A pig would produce 3/4 of a year which make the daily \u22483 to a daily \u22482,25 making (1491 * 2,25=) 3354,75 g per pig and day. But still it will need more space to be able to dig. So it\u2018ll make (3354,75 / 3=) 1118,25 g if it never rains and the pig actually does his 3 per day. \n\nThe rain/storm probability is weird and I don\u2018t really care to get the actual probability. Wiki says 18,3% in spring and fall and somewhere between 12,6% and 20,1% in summer for all non forced weather days. I make it easy on me and say 15% overall chance for rain. So it might or might not reduce pigs to the level of crackered cows. \n\nMy opinion: I like it save. I take a guaranteed autopickered enslaved cow in a closed barn over a pig. But if it comes to my crackers I\u2018d rather have Ostriches than cows. They generate more money and are way less work.", "I have five full barns of pigs and I get at least 50000 a day from the truffles, I\u2019ve never gone back to cows", "Pigs - In terms of revenue, the best of the bunch.  With even just base products (Truffles vs Large Milk), you need the pig to only need to produce 34 times to match a cow (spoilers: next most profitable barn animal).  Even stacking the odds towards Cows (Shepherd, no processing, no foraging skill), pigs match cows with 75 truffles.  So in that example, it takes 10 rainy days to make pigs worse and that ignores foraging XP from picking up the truffles and the chance for pigs to find extra truffles.\n\nThe negative is the need to find the truffles\n\nCows - Next best option.  The negative is that you need to milk them every day, but you're already petting them every day.\n\nGoats - You lose about 10% of what you get from Cows, but only need to milk them every other day.  So the bonus is less maintenance.\n\nSheep - Without processing, barely worse than a goat.  Gets better with Shepherd (doubles production, but loses Artisan), gets worse if you process.", "In year 1, forget about pigs except for the one you need for the truffle. Too much money up front and they won\u2019t really pay you back until year 2. In later years when pigs are ramped up, they\u2019re still the top money maker.", ">Even with new 1.6 benefits I don\u2019t think any other creature comes close (although I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ve seen the updated number or not yet, but I think the old numbers were well more than double for pigs, so it should still hold).\n\nStacking all the new bonuses up, Sheep now come *close* to meeting the profit margins of pigs, but pigs still beat them out by a few hundred gold per day. Still a victory for the pigs, but it's not the landslide that it used to be.\n\nIt's up to you whether the marginally higher profits from pigs outweighs the luxury of being able to just use an auto-grabber with Sheep.", "Huh, wouldn\u2019t have expected it to be sheep. Well, I go low-pig anyway. \n\nThank you for this updated information!", "Yep!\n\nLooms can spit out double output depending on what you're using as input - with Iridium quality wool guaranteeing double cloth. With the shepherd perk, you're looking at 73% of all wool being iridium quality *and* having your sheep produce every day.\n\nGet some golden animal crackers, and most of your sheep will be generating 1,880 GP per day; if you take into account the nonproductive days for pigs, it comes out to being a bit shy of what pigs will make you annually.\n\nOf course, if you stockpile cloth and then swap over to Artisan for a day to sell it alongside your wines or other artisan goods in bulk, that jumps up to 2,632 gp/day - which actually might outcompete pigs, unless you're very lucky with getting double harvests on extra truffles consistently.", ">  Iridium quality wool guaranteeing double cloth. \n\nReally?  I didn't know that!  \n\nI've always sold iridium wool because it's worth more than one piece of cloth.

This is my personal list. Feel free to make your own. Let\u2019s dive right into it going worst to best.\n\nNo in-laws: Leah, Elliot, Harvey\n\n1) Penny:\n\nI am so sorry, sweetie. If there is anyone in Stardew Valley that does not deserve their lot in life, it is you. Apart from moving George\u2019s wheelchair without his consent, (*Which is ableist, shame on you*) you are the most good-natured, pure hearted character in the valley. Becoming a teacher for no pay cause someone needed to do it. So selfless and so good. But your mother is an alcoholic drunk who drives a bus which is **a recipe for disaster.** I would hate thanksgivings and the holidays because I\u2019d watch a MIL I\u2019ve grown to love destroy themselves and possibly pass out on the couch.\n\n2) Alex:\n\nWho doesn\u2019t love having a grandma and grandpa? Especially when the grandma is the stereotypical sweet old lady who will bake you apple pie. George wouldn\u2019t be a good grandfather in law. I\u2019m sorry, old or no, cranky is cranky and it is insufferable. Especially if you\u2019re a gay man marrying him. There is one line of dialogue that comes across as closed minded.\n\n3) Haley/Emily:\n\nThey\u2019re both marriage options but one will become your SIL. I think they\u2019re both great Sister in laws. You got one that works in photography, one in fashion. They\u2019re serving it either way. They\u2019re both so cool in their own way. If you kids, they\u2019ll either have a cool aunt or a quirky aunt and kids love both! Still, for handling adult situations, they\u2019re both pretty ridiculous. Haley\u2019s messed around and found out with bull while Emily thinks she\u2019s friends with birds. They\u2019re idiots! They\u2019re lovely but they\u2019re idiots!\n\n4) Abigail:\n\nCaroline is great, let\u2019s you use he space to relax, offers to help you with your farm. Also has a place of worship in their home and hosts health exercises for all the people in her area. Just a normal nice woman exercising her hospitality to the town around her. She does not get as much love in this fandom as she should. This woman\u2019s a pillar of the community! So underrated, it\u2019s criminal. Pierre, on the other hand, kind of rightfully disliked. He succeeds with the community center being restored so he\u2019s a good guy by default. But I don\u2019t think he\u2019s any less sleazy than Morris. He seems more concerned with his business, even at events where he should be with his wife and daughter. So he negates some of Caroline\u2019s awesomeness.\n\n5) Shane\n\nAnyone who\u2019s grown up in the Midwest has met a Marnie and they are wonderful to have around. She\u2019s fun, socializes with the townsfolk and the way she looks after Shane tells me that she\u2019s very supportive and kind. That\u2019s an old fashioned woman who would give you her shoulder to cry on and the next day, take you out for dinner cause you need a change of pace. Also Jas, she\u2019s so *cute*! Little Sweet Pea living with animals in the forest. I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s actually the plot of a classic novel. Several, I think. However, Marnie doesn\u2019t value herself like she should. Girl, you deserve better than a politician who views your relationship as baggage to his career. Theirs a perfectly good monster hunter who\u2019s got his eye on you\u2026 because the other one is no longer with us.\n\n6) Haru/Sebastian\n\nDemetrius is an overprotective jerk. He threatens you when you\u2019re just hanging out with his daughter. Talk about a bad first impression. That being said, you get in laws that are both around your age and beyond. It\u2019s easier to count on a sibling in law that\u2019s also an adult and seemingly well-adjusted. Plus Robin as an MIL sounds amazing! She\u2019s so cool. But you know what\u2019s even cooler? If the farmer has kids. Robin being your grandmother carpenter goddess is amazing. She would build those kids toys, a playground, etc cause she loves them.\n\n7) Sam\n\nYou hit the lottery, my dude. I know it\u2019s not all sunshine and rainbows. Your mom misses her carefree youth and your dad has PTSD. But they are good enough people who don\u2019t have any animosity toward the farmer and even treat  them like family without a marriage. Inviting you into their home for dinner and having an open door policy with you. Jodi acts like a mother, Kent is very respectful and you get a fun-loving little brother. Plus, you can\u2019t deny that their priorities are with each other despite their own troubles.

I look like an axe-murderer chasing her around the counter!", "Oh, thanks", "Me too", "Aith a gold pickaxe!?", "Yeah, I didn't leave at all for 10 years. I chose the hilltop farm for the mining, and I'm glad I chose it over four corners; even with more space for mining nodes to spawn, it still took until midway through year 10 to reach lvl 10 mining. \n\nI farmed weeds for wild seeds, which I saved up and grew each Fall for farming experience, along with the occasional rice shoots in Spring. Once I'd reached level 9 farming (year 8, I think?), I had access to the seed maker and could start mass producing seeds from all seasons and getting my first ancient seeds. I made seeds for Summer, Winter, and Fall foraged items using Spice Berry from my fruit bat cave, mushrooms from my mushroom trees, and winter root from artifact spots in winter; this also meant grapes to grow in Fall. From there it quickly got to the point where I needed too much copper and iron for sprinklers and I had to prioritize more toward kegs for making ancient fruit wine.\n\nFinally, I kept trees in a couple areas on the farm and chopped them down regularly for foraging experience and resources. One of these patches of trees got struck by lightning early on in the run. From that I slowly grew around a hundred mushroom trees in a perfect grid and tapped a bunch of them for a steady supply of mushrooms (I think I sold 2500 red mushrooms by the end of year 10 and still had hundreds left over).\n\nThere were some interesting challenges that I discovered along the way. Lightning is a real pain when you can't build lighting rods and you're filling up the farm with stuff; it's no fun losing an ancient fruit plant or tapper to lighting strikes. Meteors are also annoying when then plop down all the time as you're quickly racing through the seasons. Early on I was often in bed by around 7:30-8 each morning. It wasn't really until year 9 or so that I started spending more time actually having to tend to the farm.\n\nAll in all it was a fun challenge, but if I did it again it'd be after 1.6 came out and I'd go further by adding monsters at night. It'd be rough because all I'd have to beat them is a scythe (1 DMG per hit) or some bombs (precious metal resources and potentially damaging to the farm), but it would provide me with a few extra resources with which to craft some really useful items. \n\nEither way, it's been fun going into year 11 now and starting to interact with the villagers as the strange millionaire hermit that rolled into town after a decade on his farm. I went joja because I'd made 4.3mil with a big sell at the end of year 10, mostly from ancient fruit and ancient fruit wine. This meant I was quickly able to build the movie theater, improve my tools, and put Robin to work full-time building for me. I was hoping for a prismatic shard from the quarry or one of my meteors so I could enter the mines for the first time with a galaxy sword, but no luck. Instead, I had to settle for entering the mines for the first time with a Neptune's Glaive that I got while grinding fishing during my first few days off the farm.", "It's your game, but there is no reason to not upgrade them, as you said you have 200 of every bar, it takes 5 iridium bars to \"max\" your pickaxe and 20 total bars for the watering can, with 14 days of winter you are probably not planting anything rn which means you can literally max it before spring and not have to worry about it anymore until you can enchant tools.", "Oh yeah I got the anvil for that but didn\u2019t get a trinket yet", "I don\u2019t think they wanted to be told since they said that they\u2019ve specifically not looked it up yet : )", "I get to like lvl 150-200 in the skull caverns and I still have gold.

I like finding them quickly.\n\n\\-Skull Cave Elevator - I really don't enjoy the mines, this made it more fun for me.\n\n\\-Look up anything - this is a QoL thing that helps me not go on the wiki every two minutes.\n\n\\-Seasonal outfits & cuter option - I mean it makes sense.\n\n\\-Canon friendly dialogue expander - I like talking and now people actually talk back!\n\n\\-Visible fish - its nice seeing them swim like fishes.\n\n\\-Elle's Greenhouse expander - I like having a big greenhouse, makes unlocking it feel that much better.\n\n\\-Better sprinklers - It's cool, specially makes irdium ones feel way more impactful once you unlock them.\n\n\\-Improved Shops - I added this since I always wondered why the shop keepers didn't sell stuff like sprinklers and such.  Honestly though this one does feel a little busted.\n\nAny help would be great.

While at first apprehensive, as the farm was located in an unknown town, we decided to start the journey together.\n\nNow, after settling in, we both started socialising around town and a really cute blonde caught my eye (let's call her Haley from now on). As I had seen a beautiful daffodil, I figured maybe it would a great introductory gift. She liked it! But, here's where the issue comes in: my best friend also noticed Haley... and became infatuated immediately.\n\nAt first it became a joke between us to see who could romance Haley quicker, and I seemed to be in the lead ,so to say (not that Haley is a prize, I really like her). But, as the farm needed more tending to and free time became scarce, I unfortunately remembered Haley's birthday too late, while my BFF slacked off to go talk to her.\n\nI was heartbroken, but I wouldn't let this one mess-up define Haley and I's relationship. However, things between her and my BFF progressed quickly, and.. I had to watch as they did the Flower Dance together. I was heartbroken. For a bit I felt betrayed and disappointed, like I wouldn't ever have the chance to show my love to Haley.\n\nWhen summer finally came, I had learned that Haley loves sunflowers. When doing the initial shopping for seeds, I put a couple of sunflower seeds aside, which I planted on the field nearer to my house.\n\nNow, this is where I could be the asshole: I didn't mention the sunflowers to my BFF, even when them being Haley's favourite flower was mentioned. I figured, y'know what, if you want to give her sunflowers, you can grow them yourself.\n\nSo, for a while I planted and harvested the sunflowers, taking every opportunity I could to gift them to Haley and talk to her. I just couldn't stay away. And while my BFF's relationship with her progressed faster, I started to catch up. At some point my BFF had asked Haley to be their girlfriend, which she said yes to. I.. felt.. you can probably assume how I felt.\n\nStill, I kept talking to Haley and gifting her flowers. When my BFF and Haley started to talk about marriage, I thought to myself: what if I just try and give Haley a boquet of flowers? What's the worst that can happen?\nWell, Haley took that as a sign of me asking her to be my GF, which she said yes to!? I was extremely happy, and confused, but most of all a little ashamed, as my BFF heard of this...\n\nNow I'm conflicted: Haley clearly has feelings for the both of us, which I reciprocate wholeheartedly, and I feel she's thinking about marriage with me as well, but I don't want this to ruin the friendship me and my BFF have.

I'll simplify it *even more* like a true ELI5:\n\n[SMAPI](https://smapi.io/) is a program that loads the mods you have into Stardew. It'll also check for any updates in the mods and let you know if any are messed up! You download it from the site I linked, extract the zip folder (right click and click \"extract here\"), and then run the program. It'll download itself to where it's supposed to be! It will open every time you start Stardew as a black box with text, and closing it will also close Stardew.\n\n[Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley) is a website where you download mods for the game. Once you find a mod you like you'll want to look at the \"requirements\", which are what it needs to run. Often this will consist of SMAPI, and sometimes a content patcher or SpaceCore, which are \"framework mods\" that help other mods function. \n\nTo download the mod you click on \"Files\" and find the correct one - usually the top one is the most recent file, but sometimes there's both a file for 1.5 and 1.6. You should have Stardew 1.6, so use that file if available. There's two buttons, \"mod manager download\" and \"manual download\". Manual download is easiest IMO! Click it, it will ask if you have the required mods, and then click \"slow download\".\n\nIn Steam, click the gear icon, hover over \"manage\", and click \"browse local files\". This will take you to the Stardew files, one of which should be an empty folder called \"mods\". This is where you want to put your mods! They will be downloaded as zip files, so make sure to extract them first (so the icon looks like a file \ud83d\udcc1 *without* a zipper on it)\n\nThat should hopefully be it. Once you open Stardew the SMAPI loader will open first and start all the mods you have, then Stardew will open like normal!", "youtube, google"]},

It makes your fishing bar as big as it would be at fishing 5. (so stop using it when you get to fishing 5 if you haven't gotten comfortable enough to ditch it before then)\n\n2) Try fishing with the joycons separated. AKA off of the switch itself (you can play in tabletop mode if you don't want/have it attached to a TV) AND not in the controller thingy you can put them in. Just one in each hand.  It helps avoid accidental B pushes, and I find it easier in general too.\n\n3) Practice. A lot. Eventually you get to the point where you are not actively thinking about when and how long to push the Y button. You just sorta...do it. Probably by the time you are actually fishing level 5 and put away your training rod. \n\n4) Once you get to where you can use the iridium rod, you want to use what I call the utility tackle. Cork, treasure, etc. The ones that affect your fishing bar or how long it takes for fish to escape, not the ones that make them bite more etc.  (I personally use treasure most of the time, because I hate having to choose between chests and risking losing the fish or no chest but a safe catch, plus it helps with the fish that dart all over a little when there is a chest in the middle, but I will use others sometimes if I'm having trouble catching specific fish I need)\n\n5) Dont forget fishing food when you are not using the training rod (I don't think it helps with that rod) as it increases your fishing bar as well... even if you are already max level fishing, it can bring your level above that while the buff is active.", "Hold down Y button", "That\u2019s so incredibly helpful. Thank you so much! I didn\u2019t know a training rod was available, I\u2019ll try it tonight! Thank you!", "That is not how it works....

I attached a picture of the .dll error and the manifest.json for the 1oxnes and talkohlooeys mod.

Berries always seem like a good way to go, but any plant that doesn't have to be replanted is nice.

If not it\u2019s okay! There\u2019s still time to make a stellar year! By the end of the year money won\u2019t be a problem at all. \nIf you want to start making your crops work for you I\u2019d first invest my time in collecting the materials you need for canning jars. Even if you only have a few for now that\u2019s all you need. Put every strawberry and cauliflower you harvest in the jar and wait 2 days for them to turn to jelly before you sell them\n\nEdit: sorry I\u2019m having a \u201cfun\u201d night so I cut off before I was finished\u2026 \nAnyway, back to the canning.. can every vegetable and fruit you can before just ploppoing them in your bin. It might take longer but you\u2019ll double your profits. And keep adding more canners as you can. Also get those tappers going because you\u2019ll want them to make honey and kegs. Tap as many trees as you can with less dedicated to pine trees. \nOnce you unlock the keg machines start filling those with your big seller crops (melon, pumpkin) and when you get the ancient seed you\u2019ll want to start duplicating it - this takes time to build up a good supply tho so rely on your crops to fill your canners and kegs. If you are 1.6 you can through stuff in the dehydrated for a quick return but less profit.\nJust keep collecting materials for canners and kegs and then when you think you have a good amount to make say 5 more check what you need for the buildings. You\u2019ll likely have it and more than enough to cover a building- it will wipe you out but if you keep canning by the time the building is done you\u2019ll be able to afford the animal you need. It\u2019s just a cycle really.\nAny rainy days or good luck days just run to the mine to collect ore asap, even if it\u2019s the mine in town! You\u2019ll collect materials you need regardless.\nDon\u2019t worry about skull cavern until you can afford a lava cantina or find a prisim shard. \nThere\u2019s really no rush at all to the game, it\u2019s actually much funner if you take it slow and don\u2019t stress.\nI read a post earlier today about how long it took people to finish the community center and it was on average 5 years the first play through. If you are looking for a rabbits foot right now- you\u2019re way past the curve. And for the record my first playthrough many times ago, I probably finished it year 6 if not later- but it was so fun, I just kept playing over and over and over.. :)\n\nEdit to change that I wrote I completed the cc year year four but that was just wrong- I really think it was year 6 but now I bang it out in year one- it\u2019s super fun still but not ever as fun as the first time around :) take your time- seriously, there is no rush", "omg, you wrote so much.

The deeper you go the more valuable materials you discover, starting with copper, then iron and finally gold ore, they sell have decently or can be used for crafting things.\n\n  \nAs you do things you level skills that unlock new recipes.\n\nThrough a combo of leveling up your skills and finding new materials you can gain access to new refining machines to make things more valuable for example, the preserves jar lets you put things in to make jelly and pickled goods which sell for 2x+50 the price of the fruit or veg deposited.\n\n  \nAnother thing to check, on the front of pierre's shop is a help wanted board, randomly villagers can request an item, holding that item and clicking on them before the time limit ends will result in some friendship which may result in them gifting you things you could then sell/use like various foods but will also give more money than the item was worth had you sold it yourself.", "Early game I forage and after the CC items are donated I just sell the forage stuff \n\nAlso check guides for most profitable crops for each season \n\nBut early game crops do potatoes until the 12th of spring so you'll have money for strawberry seeds which brings good money", "Farm.

Yesterday I posted about prismatic shards disappearing from the >!big chest!< and today I tested a theory. \n\nFor context: I decided to upgrade my crafting chests to one >!big chest!< and I went to work transferring my items (wood, stone, gems, shards, etc.), it was late but I finished and went to bed. (This was before a kind redditor pointed out that I could just put the big chest into an existing chest and it would automatically increase the capacity). Next day, I open the chest and all four of my shards were missing. I checked every chest I had and they were gone. I searched the forums for this issue and I've seen zero posts about this anywhere. I got mad so I quit for the day. Today, I get over myself and boot up Stardew again, check the chest, they're still gone. So I go to the skull caverns hoping for some reprieve, and by chance I found a shard! Yay! \n\nI decided to risk it for the biscuit and put it in my new chest. I figured, worst case its gone and I can just know to have a dedicated prismatic shard chest and I do few SC runs to make up for it. Best case, its still there. So, I go to bed. Next day comes, my shard is still there, yay! I do my errands, go to Qi for a challenge and pick up the Extended Family. I just unlocked the mini forge so I go home and make the forge to enchant my brand new >!advanced iridium rod!< using my one shard. I spent the rest of the day fishing but caught nothing and wasted my curiosity lure, so I decided to restart the day, hoping for better prospects.\n\nNow, this is where it gets interesting. I go to my chest to grab my shard to re-enchant my rod, and guess what? My shard is GONE. Poof! Recall, I restarted the day AFTER I had gone to the SC, my stuff had already saved.\n\nSo, my theory is this: If you manually transfer items (particularly a prismatic shard) to a big chest, then restart the day, it will delete your shards from the big chest. Again, I've seen no posts about this, so this is all my speculation and theory.\n\nJust wanted to put this out there in case anyone experiences the same issue.\n\nThanks for your time <3\n\nTL;DR: There may be a bug where putting a prismatic shard in a >!big chest!<, then restarting the day, causes your shards to disappear ", "score": 826, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "created_utc": 1714499773.0, "num_comments": 75, "comments": ["Please\n\n#[VOTE](https://new.reddit.com/r/StardewValley/comments/1cc9yu9/new_removed_topics_games_journalism_sign_edits/) \n\nOn whether or not to add farmer profiles to the [list of removed topics](https://www.reddit.com/r/StardewValley/wiki/removed_topics).\n\n^(To maximize community input, this comment will run on posts until the poll closes on May 1.

It's good for accumulating, but not nearly as much fun as finding forage spots. \n\nMining.... Same there really. Gemologists gives you profitable diamond farming, but more geodes means interesting results. \n\nFarming... Actually there it's tiller/artisan and not much contest otherwise. \n\nCombat.... Well you can either hit hard or not get knocked down as fast. But hitting hard means more loot and also less things hurting you so....", "Pirate might be a better Idea to finish the community center, true.

I know not many people agree with my foraging choice, which is understandable, I only have it set as lumberjack now to gather as much wood as possible, once I'm set on things I need wood and hardwood for, I'll probably switch to gatherer. I also plan on doing Pirate instead of Angler once I've caught every fish type thanks to suggestions since I wanna finish the museum at some point.", "Yeah I might decide on Pirate instead of Angler (good thing I'm not lvl 10 fishing yet lol) With getting wood it can really help since you need a lot to make all the kegs and jars you need, house upgrades, and all sorts of other things you need wood for! And getting hard wood is a good idea for better fencing and Willy's stupid boat which needs 200, it's useful for other things to. With mining, I just feel like it would be fun to get like 100 diamonds saved up then sell all of them for 30% more than their usual price, it would be CHAOS seeing how much it would make!", "If you ramp up your crit chance as outlined, you'll basically finish every enemy you encounter with a crit. If you're enjoying one-shotting monsters, crit is basically the only way to go if you want to enjoy that with late-game monsters."]},

Autograbbers can do this for you, they're 25k each at Marnie's if you have the right farming level. Not sure how this affects truffles for pigs yet as somehow all times I've stayed over at the island so far it rained back home, lol.\n\nMake sure you leave barn and coop doors open before you go; if you lock an animal out past its bedtime there are risks of attacks and they'll get grumpy. In terms of crops, try and plan it so you won't stay out long past harvest. I recommend getting a calendar from Robin's for the farm cabin, particularly if you don't have the Island Mailbox yet.\n\nAlso, think of prioritising upgrading the beach house and getting totems to make it easier in future (not going to go too in depth in case you're worried about spoilers unless you ask).

 {"permalink": "/r/StardewValley/comments/1cguvmh/efficient_qi_gem_farming_by_inflating_the_monster/", "id": "1cguvmh", "title": "Efficient Qi Gem farming by inflating the Monster Spawning Rates", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/StardewValley/comments/1cguvmh/efficient_qi_gem_farming_by_inflating_the_monster/", "selftext": "Hello. I found myself in need of 300 Qi gems by the next in-game month, so I started testing stuff in order to make this possible and I'm happy with the first results, so I'd like to share them.\n\nOutside of the **Qi Crop** quest which awards 100 gems for 3-4 weeks of work every now and then, none of the other quests feel as rewarding (except maybe \"Danger In The Deep\" and \"Skull Cavern Invasion\"). The latter 2 quests grant **7.14 gems per day**, respectively **5.71 gems/day** (as both last for 1 week only), while Qi Crop can give you in between **4.76 and 3.57 gems/day** \\- depending on the time-frame given by the quest (either 21 or 28 days). But given it's long duration, it can be stacked weekly with other quests, which will further increase the daily gems.\n\nBeside the quests given by Mister Qi, the other ways of obtaining his gems are selling Golden walnuts for 2 gems each or **getting them as drops from monsters in the** **\"dangerous\"** **version of** **the Mines** **and** **Skull Cavern**. This is what I want to focus on right now, the gems dropped by monsters. \n\nBasically, once you've gotten either \"Danger In The Deep\" or \"Skull Cavern Invasion\", you're able to gather gems from the monsters, if the dungeon' Shrine is enabled or the quest is active.\n\nThe problem is that Gems drop at an abysmal rate, so it doesn't look like you could farm them this way. Yet, with a ***certain set-up***, you can far surpass the best rate of 7.14 gems/day, offered by \"Danger in the Deep\". During the testing that lasted 6 in-game days, I've gathered **96 Qi Gems**, having **no day with less than 10 Gems** and a yield of **23 Gems in the best day**. \n\nHow it works? The first time you encounter and complete the Dangerous quests, you gain the ability to enable/disable the dangerous version of Mines with the Shrine of Challenge. So, **subsequent Dangerous quests should only disable the elevator and forcibly enable the dangerous version** of the mines, right? \n\n**Not really**. If you have previously enabled the Shrine of Challenge and then accepted the quest from Mister Qi (while the Shrine is already active), your mines/caverns are **twice as hard** as the normal Dangerous version. Monsters will have **double the spawns** and more damage. Further improve this with [Monster Musk](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Monster_Musk) and you'll have a tens of monsters spawn on each floor. But you can cook this formula some more, by searching for [Infested Floors](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/The_Mines#Infested_Floors), which will increase the number of tiles monsters can spawn on even more.\n\nNo idea if it's an intended mechanic or a bug. I'm inclined to believe it's the former, given it survived the big waves of 1.6 patch fixes.\n\nI've started with the Mines and within a few trips down, I've found the floors 60-69 to be the most rewarding ones. 5 types of monsters spawn on these floors : [Dust Sprites (dangerous)](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Dust_Sprite_(dangerous)),  [Frost Bats (dangerous)](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Bats),  [Spiders](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Spider),  [Putrid Ghosts](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Putrid_Ghost) and [Stick Bugs](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Stick_Bug). The monsters of interest are the Dust Sprites and the Spiders, as they amount for the most spawns, by far. The Stick Bugs are indeed rare but they sure are a nice find, as they always drop 1-2 Gems.\n\nAs I've said in the beginning, the best floors are the Infested Ones, followed by the floors with a big layout. A killer combo is a combination of these two.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[An Infested 62nd Floor](https://preview.redd.it/wwa5ftoydmxc1.png?width=480&format=png&auto=webp&s=be2021a24d9294fd8cefe6f07203d8e118edc76b)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[This is the loot at the end of the day, after grinding that 62nd floor. Despite having such a nice floor infested, this was the day with the least gems - 11.](https://preview.redd.it/2t9u5g9remxc1.jpg?width=1366&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ec9451834c4217e133f94680104833fcc100a1b6)\n\nThe best day - 23 Gems, during testing, was a combination of Best Daily Luck + Infested 63rd Floor, which is one of the biggest layouts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[An infested 63rd floor. Had a blast grinding it, Monsters and Drops would fill the screen. +23 gems at the end of the day](https://preview.redd.it/z9ouyo27fmxc1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c07e614c5c9b11476cb4c9c9ad8e5aea0e12caa)\n\nMy setup was the Dragontooth Club, Monster Musk (obviously), Mermaid Boots (you really need the +8 Immunity for the Putrid Ghosts, which are the bane of my existence), 2 Iridium Bands combined with a Burglar Ring and a Lucky Ring, and a level 5 Fairy (she saved so much food), Triple Shot Espresso and Spicy Eel.\n\n \n\n[Rolled some nice Innate Enchants on it. Would like to try a full-crit Dragontooch Cutlass but I've yet to get one.](https://preview.redd.it/27xs8imbgmxc1.jpg?width=1366&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ddc189245aa7437e2eae9a3bb92e8560cbb7c854)\n\nThe general strategy was to first search for any Infested Floors in the desired floor interval (I guess you could go to 41-49 and 51-59 but the Floor layouts put me off. I've also found less spiders on them and they spawn the most) and then mainly focus on them. Each time you go back to Floor 0, the Mine Floors reset but their layout and Infested state remain, so they're free grind. Then, using the Club's Special, I'd mow the biggest groups of enemies and fast towards the next floor, as Spiders jump everywhere and I'd lose too much time chasing them all. This included the Infested Floors - once most of them monsters are slain, it's reset time.\n\nAfter the 6 days of testing, I've summed the most special drops gotten too : **8 Galaxy Souls** (which saved me 320 Gems), 3 Enrichers (15 Gems), 2 Pressure Nozzles (10 Gems), **123 Golden Mystery Boxes**, **13 Golden Animal Crackers**, \\~3 Thousand coal, 1 Thousand Hardwood, 10x every Trinket in the game.\n\nAs tips :\n\n\\- Have Ginger on you on Bad Luck Days, to negate the debuff from Putrid Ghosts\n\n\\- Focus on the grouped monsters, don't chase the remaining few, go next\n\n\\- You can free your inventory during the Floor 0 resets\n\n\\- The strategy works when the Dangerous Quest is active, so don't go to floor 120 until you're done farming\n\nGiven it's the first week where I've gotten the Dangerous Quest again, I do not know if I was particularly lucky with the Gems (I definitely was with the Golden Crackers tho, 13 in one week is insane). I also cannot find info about the Qi Gems droprates on Wiki - there's only info about them dropping from crates. I've seen a 4 y.o. post saying that the lower you are in the mines, the higher odds for Gems from Monsters but I can't confirm this.\n\nYou can also use this strategy in the Skull Caverns but I found that to be more efficient for normal drops from certain monsters (you could find \\~50 mummies/ghosts on big floors). Given it's harder to reset in the Skull Caverns, I can't say they're as efficient for Qi Gems farming.\n\nTLDR : Dangerous Mines + Dangerous Qi Quest + Monster Musk + Infected Floors = \\~100 Qi Gems in 1 week", "score": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "created_utc": 1714488973.0, "num_comments": 5, "comments": ["Please\n\n#[VOTE](https://new.reddit.com/r/StardewValley/comments/1cc9yu9/new_removed_topics_games_journalism_sign_edits/) \n\nOn whether or not to add farmer profiles to the [list of removed topics](https://www.reddit.com/r/StardewValley/wiki/removed_topics).\n\n^(To maximize community input, this comment will run on posts until the poll closes on May 1.

Please do not make me your new scarecrow just yet.)\n\nI should open by saying that I have been playing a *lot* of 1.6. I love the new events, I love the new gameplay aspects, but I got into this game for the characters and I want to express my disappointment. Okay, here we go. \n\nI hate that Clint is sliding further towards being an incel, I hate that Penny is now so broken down and abused that she cries when she gets a birthday gift (are you seriously telling me that Sam and Maru don\u2019t give her gifts?) and I hate that every goddamn patch makes Demetrius a worse person and his marriage with Robin crumble further. \n\nThere\u2019s less and less room for interpretation because the most popular fanons are being canonised. \nPenny can\u2019t be a complex person with a complex relationship with her mother, she has to be a perfect Cinderella who needs to be rescued from her terrible life. \n\nSebastian can\u2019t be a complex person with a complex relationship with his family, he\u2019s depressed because nobody loves him and he needs to be rescued from his terrible life. \n\nRobin doesn\u2019t have a complex but ultimately loving relationship with her husband, she\u2019s trapped in a terrible marriage with a guy who negs her and abandons her during scary events and gets her the same gift every two years and she needs to be rescued from her terrible life (but she can\u2019t be, so the fandom can loathe Demetrius to their heart\u2019s content). \n\nDemetrius isn\u2019t genuinely trying to navigate a difficult step parenting situation anymore, he\u2019s no longer the art lover who bid on Leah\u2019s sculptures, he\u2019s a beep boop robot asshole who mistreats everyone in his family but his golden child daughter. (It was really great to have a black autistic-coded character before he got patched into the worst husband and father in the whole game, just saying.)\n\nClint isn\u2019t just a lonely guy with a crush, he\u2019s so desperate for a girlfriend that he\u2019s asking if Emily\u2019s friend is single and snapping at the farmer for being hot and socially adept. \n\nAs for Pam, it honestly feels like CA tried to humanise her in 1.5 but the fandom still hated her, so now he\u2019s leaning in to what a monster she apparently is by making Penny even more beaten down. \n\nAnd meanwhile, the less polarising/popular characters in the fandom have received no development at all except seasonal outfits. Kent wins the award for Most \u201cHe Was There\u201d Character 25 years in a row, despite the massive potential he has for worldbuilding and character development (whyyyyy can\u2019t we refer him to a therapist, we know they exist), George remains a prop in other people\u2019s heart events, and Sandy\u2026 well, she sure is Sandy. \n\nI\u2019ve never gone with popular fanon interpretations of characters, so I honestly barely talk to most of the villagers anymore because the things I liked and found interesting are just gone. I go out of my way to talk to Demetrius because I love him out of spite, and Pam because yeah it\u2019s me I\u2019m the only Pam-liker, and that\u2019s basically it.

If he didn't agree with something he would not have added it. I mean who asked for moss? Yet he just added it randomly and integrated into the game's progression I'd say perfectly. Same with the skill progression. Instead of adding the usual prestige system where you reset your skill to 1 for an xp boost and the chance to get multiple professions, he added a very unique form of that system. \n\nNeedless to say, he does whatever he wants even if he listens to fan concerns. \n\nThat being said, I feel like you genuinely do not understand most of the characters in the game. I hate the fact that you make me defend Demetrius but he has not changed. Literally the only thing that was added was the rain event. Robin has always been grumbling every other day about Demetrius \"almost blowing up the house\". They are a grumpy couple. That's been always their thing. I mean c'mon, if you finish Robin's board quest, if you don't side with him saying that Robin's new bad is tacky, he jokingly says \"if anyone needs me, I'll be in the doghouse outside\" (they have a dog??). Neither this, nor the rain event changes the fact that they are still down at the pub dancing together every friday and doesn't invalidate Emily's 8 heart event where Robin dresses up just to impress Demetrius. \n\nPam... what characterisation? She has always been the alcoholic abuser and Penny the damsel in distress. Just read the fandom's opinion on Penny. This has been the main reason for people hating her.\n\nClint, if anything has been improved after his new dialogues. He is still a loner but he is trying to move on from Emily even if he is very awkward about it (or creepy depending on how you look at it). \n\nKent is definitely a very unfortunate npc in the game I do agree with that. It would be cool if he had more to his character other than him arriving in year 2 but to be fair, his wife has even less characterisation and arguably the entire family is the most boring in the entire game (well, I argue that). \n\nThe bachelors is a completely different issue. They don't have further characterisation because they are literally fodders for the player to marry. Just as an example, imagine if we had Sebastian and Abigail start officially dating and not just messing around. Now imagine the player wants to date either (or both). How do you deal with that situation? Similarly, Sebby can't go chase his dreams in Zuzu city because that would put unnecessary stress on some players with a ticking clock if they wanna marry him, which would go against the whole thing of the game. \n\nThe funny thing is, despite essentially being bare imitations of human beings, the Stardew npcs are actually very good at portraying humans. They aren't good or bad. They are humans. If anything you trying to force every npc to be good or have qualities that completely redeem their misdeeds is the unrealistic (and boring) interpretation.", "Reading this, I feel bad for somehow being fortunate enough that my favorite villagers haven't changed at all.\n\nFrom my own experience, while the fandom is a blast, it doesn't have the best readings of the characters TBH\n\nI like Pam and Demetrius as well. I could care less about Clint, but I don't hate him like many do. Actually, I don't even hate any characters; even Lewis and Pierre has their own nuances.", "Oh, how was Demetrius made a worse person? I barely talk to him so idk much about his dialogue changes - except for the ones related to dating Maru.\n\nCan agree on Clint's part though. ^But ^I ^also ^wonder ^how ^many ^of ^these ^changes ^are ^not ^from ^CA ^but ^the ^team ^helping ^him, ^though ^he'd ^still ^have ^given ^the ^green ^light", "I think your analysis of the text is mostly completely wrong honestly.\u00a0especially Clint, Robin\u00a0and\u00a0Demetrius.\u00a0I'm\u00a0not\u00a0even\u00a0sure\u00a0what\u00a0you\u00a0are\u00a0taking\u00a0about\u00a0with\u00a0Penny\u00a0and Pam\u00a0so\u00a0I'll\u00a0let\u00a0that\u00a0slide.\u00a0\n\n\nIf you didn't already have this \"fandom\" perspective, you would not find that the new lines even support this reading", "One line about Demetrius finding his samples instead of spending time with Robin = marriage crumbling?\n\nReal relationships have occasional spats or annoyances. That's just reality.", "Unless he actually comments on it (doubtful), we have no way of knowing. But has it ever occurred to you that perhaps CA isn't \"leaning into fandom perception of characters\" so much as he is making his own intentions or feelings about the characters more explicit? You're welcome to disagree. And I can see why people might prefer to keep things more loose and open to interpretation. But just because added dialogue or events align with certain readings of characters doesn't *necessarily* mean that they were made *only* to appeal to fans or because a significant portion of fans interpret the characters through a similar lens.\n\nSometimes it looks like a duck because it's a duck.", "My possibly unpopular opinion:  the townsfolk other characters  have always been the worst part of the game.  Even with \u201ctransformative\u201d story arcs they are caricatures at best.", "My brother in Christ, don't you think it's more likely that the fandom had correctly evaluated his writing and what he's done is just a continuation of what was clearly already there?Clint was always a creep, Demetrius was always obtuse and aloof. If anything you're just mad that CA didn't change his storyline to fit your fanfics", "This entire post can be condensed into the lines \"CA didn't take MY head canon into consideration and I don't think that's cool!\"\n\n\nSeriously. What an alarmingly long way to complain that the characters aren't what YOU want them to be.", " I find it much more realistic the way the characters are portrayed compared to what you describe or expected from CA.", "Hmm, I don't really see it that way myself. I haven't seen any evidence that CA has caved to fan interpretation and that this isn't his own vision for his characters. He has said this world and the characters are important to him. I see it as the vision CA has for his characters.   \n  \nI've been loving the new dialogue, personally. Clint makes me groan and laugh because he's absolutely the character he has always been, and we're simply seeing more to explore that. Penny's insecurities are something we see because she is insecure. She also has a new conversation available after her controversial two heart event that gives more perspective on her side of the situation. I don't see any problems with it, but I'm sorry it doesn't fit how you would like the characters to be. I suppose that's the wonder of fandom! \n\nAlso, Kent has lots of new dialogue along with information we gain from his family. He was a garbage man before he went to war, he's grateful to have us as a friend, and he wishes people would treat him normally, which makes me wonder if people walk on eggshells around him since he got back. I do agree that it would be lovely to get even more, though, especially for characters that don't get much in the first place. \n\nAlso, I still find Demetrius, Pam, etc., so be interesting characters. Just because they do things or say things people in the fandom don't like doesn't mean they are meant to be hated. I for one appreciate all of the characters in their own way and enjoy their complexities and faults. Maybe take a break from fandom spaces and get to know the characters again through the in-game dialogue. There's a lot of fun little tidbits this update that come up as you play around, lots that I haven't seen people talking about yet. I've got over 1,000 hours and played almost 100 in the 1.6 update - there's a lot of little things that are easy to miss!", "I found Clints improvement good. He showed bravery during the first green rain, where he said he wants to protect everyone if something happens. \n\nRobin is finally allowed to complain about Demetrius' behaviour. Sebastian is neglected. And Penny is also neglected by an alcoholic addict. It's just how abusive families work there is nothing complex about it. There is abusive parents and their neglected children. \n\nOnly Linus was changed a bit more to some kind of philosopher, which I found odd. He became like Uncle Iroh.", "I cry almost every time that someone gives me a gift, I guess it's the little things, you know? And I don't even live in a trailer with my alcoholic and verbally abusive mother. Eh, I don't know about that part tbh.", "I actually agree re: Demetrius, I've already seen multiple posts criticising him during the green rain event for literally...doing his job, ffs. Writing an autistic-coded character when you're not autistic can so easily cross the line into the \"cold hearted robot\" trope if you're not really careful. It would have been incredibly easy to have Robin be supportive or understanding of him braving the rain to try and find the cause instead of portraying him as selfish and her as a nagging wife.\n\nCan't speak on Penny/Pam as I always found them both dull and never got most of their heart events, so I don't know what's changed between 1.5 & 1.6. I do agree about some of the bachelors feeling like the player character comes to \"rescue\" them from otherwise miserable lives though, and it's part of the reason my character never marries in-game tbh. I'm just so not an \"I can fix them\" person in games or in real life.", "I dunno. I haven't noticed anything huge. I don't agree with a lot of the fanon stuff or character hate, but I think they all still act according to my perception of their character...I mean the characters have never been the deepest, which is why people fill in the blanks with their own interpretations (well I realize that happens with all media but the source material is pretty scant here), but I still haven't seen anything that negatively affects my views of them. It's difficult to show a range of emotion when each character only says a few lines, one or two per day with a couple of random other times... so I just tend to see the \"negative bits\" as just a small part of the story.", "You hate how the characters are developing, but CA stated they are based on people and therefore are also how he perceives them. People develop, change, grow, have negative character traits, are seen the wrong way, and even put up red flags. You don't hate CA's choices; you hate the people they're based on for not being the people you want them to be. That's \"people\" though.", "Adding to this, I'm kinda sad my fave got turned into more of a borderline alcoholic in 1.6. \ud83d\ude43 Like all his new dialogue was just about him drinking.\n\nWe already got Shane, Pam, (and Alex's dad). Why did we need to add Elliott too?? There was so much more that he could have been expanded on without that.", "y'all it's just pixels on a screen lmfao", "I never understand this kind of posts, like what's the point of it. CA do what he wants (even if you think he take ideas from the fandom), do you want a game with only \"perfect\"  NPCs? pay someone to make it. Yeah i agree would be good to see Npcs grow with us, but this game never focused on lore so idk why people expect that from CA.\n\nAlso the hate to the npcs for some dialogues is dumb, Clint is just shy (and sometimes awkward) he was never an incel and the new dialogues didn't went that way at all idk what game were you playing (and yeah people can have a hard time socializing i just can't understand why do you hate that).\n\nPam didn't change at all it's just an stereotype of the alcoholic that find relief on religion and when the option of upgrade her house was a thing, it was clear that she won't change no matter what she won't stop drinking and she will always blame something else for her life. She was always bad with Penny now CA just showing how affected Penny is, are you okay just hiding it? or thinking \"it's not that bad\"? also people forget that the farmer is a fucking stranger in town, ofc Penny the girl with an abusive mother will find sus if farmer just show up with a perfect gift.\n\nDemetrius was always like that, idk what are you talking about. You think he was a good parent because he likes Leah's art? really?.", "If it bothers you that much, just mod. Mods exist that \u201cfix\u201d most of the dialogue you complain about. \n\nOne of the main ones I actually care enough to use is Demetrius on the Spectrum, which takes his autism and makes it actually autistic and not just the gross robotic mess that he's become in the base game. \n\nBoth Diverse Stardew Valley and Pride in the Valley add additional dialogue across the whole game, which doesn't necessarily change any of the things you are bitching, but does add a layer of fun, engaging, and healthy-sounding dialogue. \n\nYou can also download a mod to add a therapist to town, and pretty much everyone goes to therapy at some point, and then you get a bunch of fun healing-related dialogue and cut scenes. \n\nI am also happy to provide links to any and all of the mods I mentioned.", "r/copypasta", "I agree with so much of this, especially the way Demetrius is written. Really kills me to see such bad writing for what could be (and was) a wonderful character. Same for Clint.", "Although I don't really agree with OP, I feel like some of the comments here are purposefully misunderstanding what they are saying", "Honestly, based", "\"CA has leaned into fandom perceptions\"\n\nYou've put into words the vague unease I felt about this update.", "I never thought about it but I agree. Stardew is not a high fantasy series, the magic is leaving their stories more open.", "Yeah I mean a guy finding pride in his work and being a bit embarrassed about online dating is hardly some huge incel behavior lol I never really agreed with that reading of Clint to begin with tho.", "Exactly. It shows he is trying, and has some kind of hope or optimism, even if it is narrow. Idk. I get why people find Clint creepy, but he's in the area where you could definitely talk to a guy and help him out, he's far from gone off the deep end.", "I like this take better than mine. Still, I lost some sympathy for him because of his new dialogue after his 6 heart event. Dude really just rejected himself before Emily ever did, like, I can only help you that much bro \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I know after the new summer rain of life event, Robin will grumble about Demetrius going out to collect samples instead of staying home to protect the family.", "Right? Like incel gets thrown around a lot but he doesn't hate Emily or other women??", "Yeah the asking about Sandy thing, while cringe, also suggests he is willing to move on from Emily.\n\nWhich things were added at 1.4 and 1.5? I played before 1.5 but not enough to know what changed.", "Yea, like it's not that deep? Not to be an ass or anything but I completely agree with you", "It's impressive actually how op misses basically every character building in the game that was more subtle but the moment they are made less subtle all of a sudden they are bad because it doesn't fit whatever fanon they had.", "I think you hit the nail on the head", "Same! I've gotten into this game a bit over a year ago, but only joined this subreddit around a few months ago - and boy, oh boy, was I surprised seeing the extreme, awful opinions ab Pierre, Demetrius, Clint, etc. (even Penny and Sebastian, my usually go-to spouses!)\n\nEven tho some of the criticism might be fair, I just can't fathom such an extreme view of these characters, it's simply not that deep\ud83d\ude2d", "Maybe they are talking about the Green Rain Year 1 event where he goes fully decked out in hazmat suit. I'm not sure if that's a reading of his marriage crumbling, he's just being his usual scientist self and decided to gather samples to determine whether the rain is dangerous or not. Robin dialogue about it afterwards does shows her annoyed but I don't think its any indication that their relationship is worsening.", "there's a team helping him?? I really thought he was still doing it all by himself except for porting to other platforms?", "They're not the strongest written but I still think their presence adds to, rather than detracts from, the overall experience. Without NPCs the world would feel dead and empty, but it feels alive to me. I like talking to them and following their stories even if they aren't deep.", "I feel like this can't.be a particularly controversial opinion. It's not a knock against CA, I wouldn't.expect.the NPCs to have a ridiculous amount of depth in a farming simulator. Just enough to make the town feel nice.", "Sadly have to agree on this one.\n\nI love the characters, but the main draw of the game has always been in its GAMEplay, with the villagers only being there for flavor.", "I think you missed the point of the post entirely. Its not about how someone wants them to be, its about wanting them to feel alive and human, and not just characters that are the embodiment of that one 1-2 traits they possess and build them entirely around that and remove everything else that could have added some flavor which is what op says happened, humans are complex and we have more than 2 things in our entire lifes.", "They are pixels we can still talk about. I don't like how some peeps seem to think there's no discussion to be had about games and how they are written.", "No CA has added more to his own characters and stories and they just don't fit you and OPs particular fan perceptions. You don't like that he didn't lean into your fanfics.", "Wait what\u2019s the new dialogue?", "That's literally it though. That one event doesn't invalidate Emily's 8 heart event where Robin dresses up nicely to impress Demetrius. If anything it's in character that she grumbles about him. For christ sake Robin has been grumbling about Demetrius \"almost blowing up the house again\" every other day since the game came out.", "Protecting the family? \n\nAll the villagers walk through the rain to the saloon and huddle there. \n\nLewis says the news forecast said it's a totally normal event.\n\nA family doesn't need protection from a rainy day", "That line seemed weird to me when I got it the other day. Woman who built the house she lives in angry that man isn\u2019t home to\u2026 protect her from \u2026 strange colored rain? lol I mean\u00a0", "I scheduled robin to build my coop on the first green rain (I did not know that there is new event) and did not know about her reaction \ud83d\udc80", "Which is proof that she loves him and is worried about him.", "In 1.4, we have his dialogue when you >!take him to see a movie while playing as a female farmer (You can see a comparison with his dialogue for male farmers [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/StardewValley/comments/mea9qz/taking_clint_to_the_movies_as_a_man_vs_taking/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)).!<\n\nIn 1.5, there's a chance that he may say [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/StardewValley/comments/p1g0uu/its_okay_clint_i_can_drop_by_another_day_bye/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) when you call him on the phone, if you play as a female farmer.\n\nThe first one I can sorta understand why, but the second one is just... what even...\n\nEven then, I don't think Clint is an incel. He may be awkward, creepy, mopy, whiny, but he's not a raging misogynist. He just needs someone to smack some sense into him.", "Yeah, is CA leaning into fan interpretations? Or are people able to read between the lines and piece things together?\n\nMedia literacy? Never heard of her", "Yeah, it really hurts seeing so much misinterpretation, sometimes even toxic discourse. Hurts even more for someone who is into storytelling and character writing like myself.\n\nOn the other hand, you have frankly over-the-top love for the popular characters (Robin, Krobus, Haley etc.). My favorite characters are mainly on the less popular side, so the discourse around them  are much less extreme and more \"genuine\" to me. \n\n(Willy is the one popular villager I'd agree with everyone on though. Love the old fisherman!)", "I never really get why people think their marriage is on thin ice tbh. They're always shown to be happy together despite their differences. \n\nThe ONLY indication of there being ang unhappiness is during the clothing therapy scene, where Robin wants to get Demetrius's attention. And even then, that could be because she wants to deepen their love rather than trying to salvage a failing relationship.", "Uhhhh that's such a stretch? Isn't he just being his usual scientist self -", "Yeah that's a strange interpretation if that's it. There are only a few moments in the game to really show each character, and Demetrius is a scientist. It is natural he would study a new phenomenon, just as it is natural his wife would be worried about it - that doesn't mean he's a dick or that their marriage is in shambles. It also makes sense he relates well to his daughter who shares his interests vs his stepson who doesn't. Doesn't mean he doesn't care.", "I know the creator of SVE helped in development. Four people other than CA himself were credited for the 1.6 update in the game menu", "He's doing it by himself, pretty much. He has a team that is handling the stuff other than developing the game itself.", "UnPopUlAr opinions are never unpopular", "This isn't what happened though. There's an amount of dialogue added in the latest update. Nothing was removed. The characters are just as much what they were before the update, if CA wanted the new lines to reinforce certain aspects of the characters then that's valid and to criticize it because the lines don't reinforce OPs personal head canon, is ridiculous.", "you don't think it's tired to rehash the same npcs over and over", "And what fanfics would those be?", "[Images 2-5](https://www.reddit.com/r/StardewValley/s/cLwJhL1maE)\n\nI was pretty pissed because I set them up for nothing", "Robin doesn't know it's fine though. It's frightening because it's a weather event they've never seen before in their lifetimes. Demetrius chooses his passion of studying science over being with his family when they're scared and worried about him.", "Ah yeah those are icky, not incel though imo, just doesn't understand the social cues or how to be friends with a woman. Which isn't great, but again, he's got room to learn.", "Yea, and tbh I think there was only so much CA was willing to do without basically decimating the work of all the people that have developed mods, people who have basically put all their time and effort into this game just like he did. It was even made known that a lot of modders got early access to the game so they could write compatible updates and the game would run as smoothly as possible post-release. And to use some of the mods to explain what I mean, take Kent in SVE; I\u2019ve seen some comments complaining that nothing really happens for him in 1.6, but he already has a ten-heart event (in SVE), >! instead of giving him a repeat event like Shane\u2019s where he\u2019s talked into getting therapy, he joins the Adventurer\u2019s guild, and his character can even be seen at the guild-house occasionally. !<", "So true!\n\nThe same way the over-the-top hate confuses me, I also can't relate to the over-the-top love that Robin, Haley, etc. receive. Don't get me wrong, I've definitely romanced Haley and enjoyed her heart scenes!\n\nBut I just don't understand why people idolize them while villainizing other characters based on a few dozens dialogues? Especially when Robin is known by being hot-tempered and Haley is coded as a bit shallow/looks-focused, so they're not exactly perfect either!", "People think one or few cutscenes of showing them arguing and Demetrius being a bit of a blockhead when it come to social cues and not being a good enough step-father for Seb is enough evidence of their marriage being on thin ice.", "They go dance together every week on a date night, and the other conflicts are one-off things mostly to do with Demetrius's very practical nature. Imo.", "Exactly, Robin is shown annoyed yes but that's mostly because she is worried about him. They don't know if the rain is harmful or not in the first year after all.", "IIRC he's still doing all of the writing and music himself. He has help with programming and art, though he still has to green light everything.\u00a0", "I mean you can ignore the conversation if you think its not worth talking about, but I still think its interesting to discuss", "If you agree with OP that CA is \"leaning into the fandoms perception of characters\" then you're merely not a fan of *his* additions to his own characters. It's not like some outside entity did this, the creator did. You and OP are just not a fan of him reinforcing some of the concepts the characters portray. That's not the \"fandom\" that's the creator. Weird take overall.", "But what is he gonna do to protect them against the weather?", "After the first green rain, it becomes normal except I think a select few are still scared. But I don't spend too much time talking to them to remember for sure", "Or maybe you can take out your bias feelings towards him and think that he is just a cientist gathering data to figure out if the things are safe or not for everyone in the village.\n\nWhat he is doing is totaly normal (for a cientist), his family is safe in the basement, he is in full gear to see wtf is going on a find out if the rain is safe or not, what is he going to do down in the basement with everyone else, hold hands and pray to Yoba?", "He\u2019s literally standing right outside of their house during the green rain event. He doesn\u2019t trek to the other side of the town or anything, he\u2019s right there for Christ\u2019s sake.", "For some people when they love a character, they tend to overlook their flaws and sometimes view them as completely devoid of them despite canon material. Same goes for hated characters but their likeable traits are overlooked.\n\nIt's a binary way of thinking, categorizing a character as either bad or good. This is honestly not exclusive to the Stardew fandom, almost every fanbase does this sort of thing and it's very annoying to see.", "Yeah, it's ridiculous honestly.\n\nRobin herself clearly isn't the best mother either, and Sebastian is just... Sebastian. Even Maru herself has some (small, but still) problems.", "That's a lot of words for 'I don't know'.\n\nYou just can't handle the fact that some people don't like the 1.6 as much as you do.\n\n*Weird take overall*\n\nedit: and after posting that zinger below, the coward blocked me so he could have the last word.", "Well, I don't think they need protection per se. I'm just saying he chose his passion over being with his family when they were worried about him and would have preferred him hide in the basement with them. I thought it was really fun to see him out there in his hazmat suit, and I also felt like the whole interaction made them feel like real people who might get excited about their passions and make mistakes that hurt their families. I don't agree with op that it's a bad thing, I just wanted to point out to that other person who acted like the rain was fine that Robin didn't know it was fine and that's why Demetrius's actions might negatively impact their family", "Ok. Yes, I got the impression from Robin that is what she wanted him to do, stay in the basement and pray to Yoba. I didn\u2019t say there was anything wrong with what he did instead, I\u2019m just talking from the perspective of their family, they\u2019re really scared, and they don\u2019t want Demetrius out there in a potentially deadly weather event. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m biased, I like Demetrius and enjoyed seeing him in his hazmat suit excited about the mysterious rain.\u00a0", "Sure, and it turned out to be harmless. But for all Robin knows, it\u2019s acid that melted him instantly. And he doesn\u2019t come back inside at all until late into the night while Robin is freaking out not knowing if he\u2019s okay\u00a0", "I think its mostly people projecting their own grievances about their own father to Demetrius so yeah.", "And that's a lot of words for \"I can't explain why I don't like it without using my own incorrect interpretation of the characters as my justification\"", "I mean that's fair, I just don't know what anyone would expect him to do differently. Again since he can't protect them from the weather. I would understand if it was framed like she's worried about his safety, but he can't help them in the house.\n\nTbh if I was a scientist even tangentially related to biology, meteorology, or geology... I don't know if I could pass up an opportunity to study an unprecedented - and as far as I know, once-in-a-lifetime - occurrence. That sort of knowledge could be a life's work.", "Im just pointing out, maybe its not his passion for cience but his duty as a cientist what drives him to be out there. I know he also REALY enjoys what he does, but still lol...", "Do the villagers walk through the green rain to the saloon in the morning, or are they already there when the player wakes up?\n\nIf Robin can walk from her house to the saloon in the rain, then Demetrius is a 1000% safe while wearing a full hazmat suit", "That's the most baffling thing to me. I'm all for filling in the blanks, since Stardew characters are specifically designed for it. But projection? Really?", "I would probably too if I were him. I don\u2019t think it should be any different. I was just talking about my interpretation of his family\u2019s perspective, maybe I didn\u2019t get my point across properly", "Oh I got you, it\u2019s his duty, his job.\u00a0", "I know, you're fine \ud83d\ude42."]},

People fight so much over it, but there doesn't need to be a right or wrong-\n\nShe was very wrong to kill people, but right to be mad over her kits being exiled. Oakstar, Ravenwing both didn't even care or spare a ounce of sympathy towards the kits or the situation. Oakstar broken the code by sending the kits out. Freckewish was least bad out of all three. Her behavior treating Mapleshade like a.. vessel for the kits, in place of her brother, instead of her own person, is annoying to me. And her calling the kits half clan creatures. But she was just grieving really hard in the end. She didn't really do as much imo. Mapleshade did literally lie right to her face about the kits, I would be upset too. \n\nSome people say Mapleshade was toxic beforehand, but still doesn't mean she deserves all of that. Not to mention, I feel like a lot of warrior cat relationships kinda are.. especially some of the toms. Then Appledusk was cheating on her with Reedshine, so he sucks too. Especially for covering it up, then turning her and the kits down. Riverclan leader (forgot the name) kinda sucked too for kicking her out, especially because her kits just drowned..\n\nSo many other characters have had half clan loves and got off scott free, and other things. Mapleshade was done dirty if you ask me. \n\nOne of the authors said she had hallucinations of her kits begging to be avenged, so that's why she killed. It feels like a huge author excuse though, nor does it make it right. Mapleshade did love her kits though, some people seem to pretend she didn't.\n\nThen she kills, which is wrong. That's when she becomes a bad person/villian. She looses victimhood after that. \n\nAlso this isn't canon, but one of the authors said Frecklewish went to the DF for letting kits drown. There is NO way Frecklewish could of saved those kits. This part feels sexist almost, the one women goes to the df over the pettiest thing. Like what!\n\nSome of the later on books has Mapleshade saying stuff like \"we should kill the kits!\" \"You have a loving life and I don't, you should die\" \"I would like to take over the body of a young, pretty she cat. Imagine that.\"\n\nThat last one rubs me so wrong man, it feels a little out of ring for her unless she's truly lost it. If anything, it feels like more gender issues from the writers. \n\nSorry for talking so much, I like talking to people who like Warriors and Mapleshade is a really complex character in her actions imo"]},

If every entry failed its skill check, random trash is hooked instead.\n\n>influences of targeted bait\n\n* location chance is multiplied by 1,66, capped at 1 (only relevant for nightmarket and mine fish, every other non-legendary fish already has the maximum possible location chance of 1\n* spawn rate is multiplied by 1,66, capped at 1 (this is the value for the skill check, and ofc multiplication has more impact when the number multiplied itself is high)\n* it looks at the first three succesful skill checks, if the target is within them, the target is hooked otherwise the 3rd succesful entry\n* the list performs checks a second time before trash is hooked. (trash from the first run counts as one of the three sucessful checks)\n* Stone Fish (10 %), Ice Pip (9%) and Lava Eel (8%) from the mines use a different spawn mechanic and therefore ignore the usual effects of targeted bait. They add the respective chance instead\n\n>Summer Sturgeon (ST) - Fall Catfish (CF) comparison\n\n* Sucess chance: ST: 35% ->  58,1% (17,5 % to fail both checks if list loops); CF: 40% -> 66,4 % (11,2 % to fail both checks if list loops)\n* amount other Fish: ST: 5-6 (1\\*Sun only Rainbow Trout); CT: 5-7 (2\\*Night Fish Bream & Walleye)\n* Sucess other fish ST 2\\* 45 % (Chub + Carp), 1\\* 40 % (Largemouth) 2\\*35 % (Rainbow Trout + Bullhead) 1\\*30 % (Green Algae)\n* Sucess other fish CF 2\\* 45 % (Smallmouth + Bream), 2\\*40 % (Salmon + Walleye), 1\\*35 % (Shad), 1\\*30 % (Green Algae), 1\\* 20 % (Tiger Trout)\n\nUnder optimal conditions both fish have 5 competitiors, but CF has a higher chance to pass its own check and CF's competitors fail easier making it more likely for CF to be in the first 3 sucessful checks.", "Some of the rarer/harder fish the bait seems weird with yeah.  Octopus for example.", "You aren't fishing later in the day are you? I have had reasonable success with farming sturgeon, but you need to remember they stop spawning at 7pm.", "I'll keep testing but so far I've had MUCH better luck in Winter. Even just fishing from 2pm-7pm got me 11 sturgeon in maybe 20 catches. Catfish still seemed better but I'm not sure if it's due to luck (the skill or the real life luck) or due to Summer vs. Winter. I'm still catching an unfortunate amount of lingcod but the sturgeon catch rate is more or less keeping up with my smokers at least!", "Nah. Early on I made that mistake (largemouth bass also disappear at 7!) But I'd be fishing from noon to 7pm and only catching 2 or 3 sturgeon.", "Hmm, I guess I'm fishing in winter, but regularly pull 8 or so per day.", "Even that seems low for a full day of fishing with the dedicated bait! I used largemouth bass bait during Spring and caught over 20 per day typically. If I start early enough, I can do the same for catfish. I wonder why some fish are abundant and some aren't?\n\nMaybe I'll do a test with a sonar bobber comparing the sturgeon catch rate with deluxe bait vs. Sturgeon bait to ease my paranoia...", "Maybe it was luck, maybe it was Summer having different catch chances for fish. I'm in Winter now and usually catching at least 10 sturgeon in 5 in-game hours.", "Well, Largemouth bass are easier to catch in the first place, so that explains that discrepancy. \n\nI think there's definitely a threshold of frequency where the bait 'works' - e.g. it doesn't do a lot with lava eels because there's a high trash rate. I assume there's elements of size of pool and spawn frequency. \n\nE.g. a 20% spawn rate will be multiplied up to be 'almost every catch' where a lower spawn rate will still not be all that thigh even when amplified. \n\nTargetted bait didn't work well for Lava Eels. I found it went pretty well for Sturgeon though, and catfishing too. I _assume_ that catfish in the secret woods should be pretty good, but I've not tried it yet. \n\nAnd it wasn't 'full days' really - just doing it sort of ad hoc."]},

I suggest doing the game first thing in your game day and then whatever farm chores you have so you're not doing farm chores over and over only to reset those too. (Yep, I cheesed it, no way was I getting lucky enough to do it in one go.) Exit the game after each stage win assuming you didn't die and restart the game entirely if you can't buy the ammo upgrade first thing is my advice. It seriously takes longer getting to the saloon than dying in that game sometimes and is a massive headache. Getting the home arcade first by beating the saloon game however you can is entirely recommended. There is a spot next to Fector's bullets you can be safely at the very top of the screen and still hit him without being hit yourself. You'll be fine as long as he doesn't spawn adds which means some rng is also involved but it is far easier than actively dodging his bullets.  !<", "score": 5, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "created_utc": 1714453620.0, "num_comments": 1, "comments": ["Please\n\n#[VOTE](https://new.reddit.com/r/StardewValley/comments/1cc9yu9/new_removed_topics_games_journalism_sign_edits/) \n\nOn whether or not to add farmer profiles to the [list of removed topics](https://www.reddit.com/r/StardewValley/wiki/removed_topics).\n\n^(To maximize community input, this comment will run on posts until the poll closes on May 1.

My numbers look different from yours and I'm not inclined to believe yours lol", "My takeaway from this is that cranberries are better for the farmer who wants to invest big in a large infrastructure, whereas sugar would be better for the farmer who would be content with slightly lesser profit to free up more time and resources for other things, since you can just dump all the beets at once in the mill at the end of the season, instead of having to refill a large number of jars.", "My processing shed is being used for pineapple jelly and wine. The wine heads down to the cellar and the jelly just ships. The cranberries or pumpkins would ship as just the veg.", "I like giving her chocolate cake. :)", "Optimizing my farm IS fun. The mathematics. The talking to other experienced \"farmers.\" Exploring different options. The actual path to getting there. Seeing how high I can get the number and how quickly. Slowly improving things with time and effort. Y'know, all the things that don't happen in real life. \n\nAlso, I don't care for the fishing, personally. Like I've maxed it because it's necessary to complete and collect, but it doesn't bring me joy. BUT I'm glad you enjoy it. World needs people who love to fish", "Did something change in 1.6? Because the Mill has never bottlenecked me the way Kegs and Jars did. I could put as much wheat, beets, and rice into the mill as I wanted, even all at the same time, and next day BOOM they're all processed.", "Nah. However much you put in of one item type it spits that much out tomorrow.", "Basically, yes, but pumpkins would be even less effort, and wouldn't require a mill.", "You should definitely try out dehydrating all of your fruits (crans, blueberries, hot peppers, strawberries, tree fruit etc) especially no star ones- before shipping if you aren\u2019t canning or kegging, it really adds up quick and only takes a day. I\u2019ve built like 20 dehydrators and it\u2019s really been worth it for all the little extras for sure\n\nAlso, as a good tip save your pumpkins/cauliflower to fill the kegs and cans while you are building up your seeds/fields of pineapple/ancient fruit etc and collecting materials for new kegs and canners. You\u2019ll run out of fruit like ancient/pineapple if you are building up fields from scratch and this way you always have something good processing.", "Yeah, I'm just trolling along. My kids won't play with me anymore because my farm looks like a labor camp now. \n\n  \nThe best part of fishing is watching a new person learn how to do it lol", "Afaik the mill hasnt changed and works as you described, it takes one day to process whatever amount of crops you leave in there, Using Kegs or Jars on the cranberries would get more profit but would indeed require way more time/machines compared to turning beets into sugar, still i dont have the numbers to really compare things in that large scale.", "Honestly this whole thing is making me rethink some optimization that I've historically tried to achieve. When I pick up 1.6 and get back on the modded game, as long as Automate still functions as always, I'd probably keep my global-keg/junimo chest-engine running, but for vanilla on the switch I may try to spend some seasons producing significantly lower-effort crop to toss in a mill while I try to focus on other parts of the game, particularly while doing challenge runs that limit my activities.", "Wheat is a 1 to 1 ration on flour so it doesn't really benefit except that you have a chance at getting hay, too.", "The main attraction is it produces MUCH faster than beer, especially since you don't need to run around a hundred kegs every couple days to rotate production. So Rice in Spring (40g buy for 100g output), Wheat for Summer (10g buy for 50g sell, or turn it ALL into bread for 60g sell), and Beets in Fall (20g buy for 150g sell). Beets have by far the best ratio, but Wheat being available in Summer and giving SOME hay is a fair tradeoff to Beets being the superior choice.", "Fair enough. Didn't think about using the flour for cooking. Which is odd because I do make homemade bread irl lol", "lol the life feels is so real.\n\nThough a thought, 50-60 g for a 10g buy and 4 day growth cycle may still be comparable to Beets having a 150 sell to 20 buy at SIX days growth cycle. So if we measure it by profit-per-day of growth, Wheat is earning max 10g per day of growth+mill time (60-10 divide by 5 days to process), while Beets are getting around 18 per day(150-20 divide by 7 days to process)...\n\nOK beets still superior but still, only available in one season lol"]},

This gets asked here most days so you can search to find other responses, but the standard advice is good luck days + luck buffs + arrive early + lots of bombs + staircases.\u00a0", "TL;DR [Salmence's](https://youtu.be/ufABBYy8J5Q?si=uhCq98AGUhn85i0y) guide on YT helped me a lot. More advice below. (Note: I wrote all this up pre-1.6, but I think it should all still apply. I'll add some 1.6 notes where it seems appropriate.)\n\nPreparation is key! You should ideally have:\n\n* Bombs: easiest way to get them is to buy from the Dwarf, but you can also craft them. I like to have about 40 each of regular and mega bombs, but you can probably get by with fewer, since enemies will sometimes drop them. If you're trying to get deep in the cavern, you should almost never be using your pickaxe, just bomb everything till you find a ladder or a hole.\n* Food/Drink: Have a stack food with no buffs that just restores health - cheese is a popular one, or sashimi, or berries, whatever is easiest for you to get. (The new 1.6 seasonal veggies are good for this, if you can get a good supply.) Eating this won't remove any buffs you have from your other food. Then bring something that gives you a useful buff: speed, luck, or defense are all good. And finally: coffee or, better yet, triple espresso. The speed is a huge help. You can have 1 food buff and 1 drink buff active at the same time, for example: espresso for speed, and spicy eel for more speed and luck.\n* Luck: Using food for this is great, but you can improve your odds even more by going to the cavern on the highest luck days. The most important thing luck does for you is increase your chance to find ladders and pits faster. (For 1.6, if you have Farming and Mining >!Mastery!< unlocked, definitely use the >!craftable statues!< to get additional daily buffs!)\n* Staircases: If you have some jade saved up, trade them for staircases at the desert trader on Sunday. If not, you can craft them, I'd aim to have 20\\~40 before you make a serious run. (More is always better, but just do what you can for now!) Use these if it's taking too long to find ladders, if you run into an infested level, or one of those long spiraling levels. (Edit to add: as long as you use less than 10 staircases, Mr. Qi won't be rude to you about it, lol)\n* A good weapon: Get the galaxy sword if you're able, or buy a lava katana from the Adventurers Guild if you aren't. However, you should be avoiding most monsters if at all possible. Fighting them takes up precious time you could be climbing deeper.\n* Rings: Number one, imo, is the slime charmer ring. If you haven't got it yet, it's worth it to spend some time grinding out 1000 slime kills to get the immunity to slimes. This will allow you to just ignore a good portion of the enemies in the cavern. As for a second ring, it's up to what you have available, you can experiment with different buffs to see what works for you. Iridium band if you have it, for an attack boost, or another good one might be the crabshell ring (get it from the adventurer's guild for killing 60 rockcrabs) for a +5 defense.\n* Inventory Management: Make sure your inventory is arranged efficiently. Dump all tools except your weapon and pickax, and try and set it up so that you are only one click away from your essential items. So for example, I keep my sword and pickax in slots 1 and 2 on my home row, and my bombs at the end of the row in spots 11 and 12, so I can quickly scroll over from sword to bombs with the left shoulder button (ymmv if you're not using a controller). Then whatever my HP refill food is (usually cheese) is in row 2, spot 1, so it's just one click away with L2/R2. Triple shot espresso will be right next to that, and then staircases in row 3 spot 1 for quick access. Developing muscle memory here can save your life!\n\nGood luck!", "yeah going for that right now, but i found our the dioluge is diiffrent if u use them, so i kin+da wnat to dot without hem", "Napalm Ring can also work, but not too reliable but could be nice if you want to kill some enemies and break rocks at the same time. \n\nUsing staircases (as one other person here said) is in execution, very easy and 100% works. But the preparation for said method is *V E R Y* slow and tedious as it'd require either:\n\u2022 Lots of money for Stone\n\u2022 Jade Farming\n\u2022 Or >!Crystalariums!<", "still new to reddit, did not really know how to serach for it but thank you!", "thank you!", "wait i never thought about using the vrytalarium for jade,mine are filled with dimonds :D", "Desert Trader can give 1/1 Jade-to-Staircase trades.", "And different gemstones actually take differing amounts of time to dupe from what I know."]},

For all the straight men having a hard time getting it, imagine having a genuine friendship with a guy only for him to suddenly confess that he's developed feelings for you, and when you reject him he dejectedly cuts all contact. That was all he wanted from you, and if he can't have it, all the bonding and conversation up to that point was for nothing.

He\u2019s not a bad guy in the slightest!\n\nIt\u2019s disappointing because he\u2019s a nice character and he deserves a bit of an overhaul to expand upon him. All the non marriage candidates are kind of weak in comparison to the others, mostly because they don\u2019t have as many heart events.", "I think a lot of people have learned to be afraid of insecure nice people, because a certain amount of desperation for emotional connection leads to really unbalanced and unhealthy relationships (friendship or otherwise).

From a guy's perspective, it's often times not that they are only interested to be in a relationship. Often times it's a genuine connection, platonic or not, and then feelings start to materialize and when they're rejected it hurts. And being friends isn't easy when any time you do anything you're always reminded of those feelings. So it's easier to just let it go until you can get over those feelings. It's the mature thing to do imo, rather than keep a friendship going where you feel unhappy and might have unchecked emotions. I'm not talking about stardew in particular, Clint is a bit of a weirdo, but I do think this is a more nuanced topic than \"he only wanted me for a relationship\"", "Oh yea, Alex. Let me rephrase then. Clint doesn't have dynamic dialogue for Emily's relationship status. To my knowledge", "This was made before 1.6, also should of said cutscenes/heart event . To my knowledge anyway", "Well, the custcene was made years ago when Emily became a marriage candidate. Of course, seeing how 1.6 added new dialogue for Clint went you give Emily a bouquet, seeing Clint saying \"congrats\" to you on this cutscene doesn't make sense anymore.", "I play on switch so I don\u2019t have the update yet ^^", "I have been absolutely terrified by people who \"didn't mean to be creepy.\" If you are making someone uncomfortable, it is your responsibility to learn and grow from that. I used to be socially inept too, maybe I didn't come across as creepy Idk. But I recognized it was my problem to deal with and learned how to cope with my ineptitude. People act like socializing isn't a skill you have to learn just like anything else.", "Clint receives no feedback regarding his actions and Emily never appears uncomfortable due to them. How is he supposed to know to fix anything?", "I think it doesn't excuse the way he *does* behave, but it being unintentional gives us some hope that he won't stay that way for the rest of his life. He and Emily would never work as a couple, but he's capable of shaping up and getting into a healthy relationship in the future.", "Read your second phrase, now read the first one.", "Marlon is pretty much the only non marriage candidate that isn't misrepresented in the worst possible way by fans", "This \u201che\u2019s just insecure and socially anxious\u201d defense always bugs me because many incels are also, in fact, insecure and socially anxious. The entire incel community functions as it does because it preys on socially awkward men\u2019s insecurities, presenting those insecurities as unchangeable flaws in their personality that women are at fault for not accepting. Clint\u2019s not quite at the incel level, but if you\u2019ve ever met anyone like him IRL he certainly comes across as someone just a few clicks away from that pipeline because he just does not view women normally. He struggles to find success in romance because he views women as romantic options first, people second (as shown through moments like the Clothes Therapy scene where he congratulates the player on what he perceives to be dating Emily, as though he views her as a prize to be won, or the dialog he has about Sandy where he immediately asks if she\u2019s single, or the outing to the movie theater the player can ask him to that he assumes must be a date *only* if you\u2019re playing as a woman.)\n\nIt\u2019s also a weird defense because it pretends that Clint is the only insecure/socially anxious character in the game. Shane and Sebastian both exist; Shane\u2019s entire arc revolves around his insecurities and Sebastian has multiple lines indicating social anxiety, yet no one- not even players who hate these characters (and Shane especially gets a lot of hate)- calls them incels the way they do Clint because they don\u2019t have numerous scenes where they objectify women or treat women fundamentally different from how they treat men. They\u2019re just normal guys with issues, unlike Clint who comes across like the type of person who thinks getting a date will solve all his problems, yet can\u2019t even talk to women because he treats them like a different species. He\u2019s a very frustrating character because he reflects how many men IRL act- a type of behavior that more often than not results in women being forced into extremely uncomfortable situations, where a person they thought was their friend suddenly changes their attitude the minute she\u2019s no longer a romantic option. Clint is literally doing that in these screenshots.\n\nThe fandom isn\u2019t \u201cmisrepresenting\u201d him, they\u2019re interpreting dialog and scenes that he canonically has in the game, most of which indicate that he\u2019s extremely Not Normal about women and would probably be whining about getting \u201cfriendzoned\u201d if he was shown to have any friends to whine to.", "You\u2019re right. It\u2019s always been the \u201ccongrats\u201d in this dialog that makes me want to strangle him. She\u2019s not a trophy.", "Oh yeah, I just assume I hit a nerve with anyone that downvotes", "Maybe becoming somewhat of a father figure to Penny would make him think about others instead of feeling sorry for himself all the time. That's the reason he'll never get with Emily. He's too much of a sad sack and she's so full of hope.", "Hell, it's not just guy's who can be awkward dorks who develop awkward feelings for a friend. I've developed crushes on guy friends and ended up blurting out tactless comments or reading way too much into the things they said to me and driving myself insane. It's a lot better for everyone involved if you just step back and cool off which is a lot harder to do if you live in a small town and have a limited number of people to befriend in the first place", "The mature thing is to talk about it and not ghost people. That feels like a revenge for the rejection.", "I think part of this if you'll allow me to speculate, comes from a couple of the minor but possibly toxic bits of masculinity.  \n\nBeing masc often means being stoic.  Means not sitting and working through difficult emotions with your friends, and figuring it all out on your own for better or worse.  It means not being a burden, at all costs.  But you *do* talk about those things when in a romantic relationship.  The rules change there.\n\nFem roles don't have this stipulation.  Being emotional is expected (unless it's too public, but that's another sexism issue entirely).  Women chatter about their broken hearts, wishes, and hurts with each other more comfortably. And rightly so, we all should!  So a woman being a good friend may often inadvertently wind up connecting platonically with a man who hasn't adjusted to that unhealthy pattern they were raised with, in the man's *romantic* social language.\n\nI noticed it in myself and it took some adapting but I think realizing that helped make more sincere friends with the women in my life too.", "But why punish the other person because of your feelings that are hard to get over?", "Yeah, I triggered this when I had been married to Haley and Clint still acts like this.\n\nI think people need to accept that not all heart events are dynamic.", "My personal headcanon on out-of-sequence event-scenes like this is that it did happen sometime ago offscreen, and the farmer is reminded of it by being at that location again that day for some reason, like you kind of are sometimes.", "Him not being written to change does not mean he doesn't have creepy behaviors.", "I'm confused lol? My whole point is that just because you don't know you are being an asshole or creepy or whatever else doesn't excuse it", "i think willy is pretty safe too. i always see people wanting to marry him", "Honestly I don't even like engaging with the fandom if it's about romances and jsut the characters in general because everyone seems to be so hostile towards characters they just personally don't like, and I just don't get it at all. Like you could watch a video about your favorite bachelor/ette and the replies are full of people explaining why they hate them. Why??? \n\nYou don't have to like a certain character but why do so many fans feel the need to instantly label them as the worst things possible to justify their dislike? It's ok to admit they're not for you and move on.\n\nThe one I hate most is the \"non-con\" Elliott kiss. Suddenly kissing someone in a moment of passion/after a confession is like one of the most basic romance tropes ever, and he is not even doing that, you are DATING him by that point. I understand that in real life it would be a much more complicated situation but it is a game, you \\*know\\* that Elliott is obviously won't try to assault you \"trapped\" on that boat if you reject him because he is obviously \\*not\\* programmed to do so.\n\nWhile yes, you can absolutely view these things critically and have a conversation, at the end of the day it is still a game, and applying these very heavy labels to them just feels a bit... icky to me.", "It's still a step better in my opinion to step back and work through the emotions rather than involve the other person and risk saying something you'll regret later. It's hard to have genuine discussions when emotions are running high", "You wouldn't ask the other person to put their feelings aside and get into a relationship with you despite not being attracted would you? Same logic here. If they feel miserable in a friendship because of unrequited love, they're completely justified in letting the friendship go and shouldn't be shamed for it. If you're a true friend, you'd accept that and welcome them back once they got through their emotional baggage. If you're not, you'd go to others to complain about how much of a jerk he is for not doing things exactly how you wanted", "on the flip side, you are punishing them every time you are hanging out.", "A lot of times in these situations, the two people are the primary connections between friend groups, and it's just really easy to drift away from an awkward situation when the other person isn't that well integrated with the other person's friends.", "you've never been on the side where you've been rejected have you?", "He doesn\u2019t *know* his behavior is creepy so how is he supposed to change that?", "Not really\n\nThere's a difference between being socially or romantically inept andastraight up toxic incel", "Honestly I think they are the same person in my mind, but you are right", "This is how I feel about Demetrius and penny lol.

The one with the feelings is the one responsible for dealing with those feelings if they're unrequited.

My point is only about who's to blame.\u00a0\n\n\nI'm going to start using Clint/Emily bc this is getting confusing. Emily bears no responsibility for Clint's romantic feelings. There is definitely some work on her part in rejecting those feelings to be kind, understanding, and respectful. But if all that happens and Clint can't move on as friends then that's really just his problem and it sucks for Emily. That's all I'm saying.\n\n\nI think I'd agree with you that if Emily said \"I respect your feelings and since they aren't going away, I'll distance myself to make it easier for you,\" then that would make her an incredibly compassionate, mature, selfless individual.

Clint is just as valid in distancing himself if he feels unhappy around Emily because of his unrequited feelings as Emily is in rejecting his romantic advances because she doesn't feel the same way. It's an unfortunate situation for both parties and blaming either of them makes you sound like you lack basic empathy. I'm sorry but I don't think there's anything else to argue about here.

Even the way some people describe here kinda shows how much people are making up their own narrative, talking about some people referring to Clint hiding in Emily's bushes, making it sound like he was stalking her. While in reality all he did was getting scared, jumping into a bush to hide and waiting for them to leave so he can return back home. Which btw only gets triggered if the player is not on 8/10 hearts with Emily yet.", "I definitely have. It sucks and it was my burden to bear.", "I think that's a much better take.

Unintentionally being a creep (and not even having the chance to change because you are simply programmed AI forced to live through the same cycles constantly) does not make you a bad person. That's my entire point\n\nBut the behavior is still bad and it's okay to call it out and criticize the behavior and in tandem criticize the character because it's hard to not criticize behaviors and also the character at times\n\nBut that is not the only thing that defines them.

I think context and intention is what mostly matters when I judge what other people are doing, even if I think it's initially awkward.

(Or had it happen to you?) Like a joke gone too far? You didn't intend to hurt them, but the hurt is still there.\n\nHiding in someone's bushes in front of their house is inherently creepy behavior, and people are not wrong to feel that way about it, Clint included. It's *because* of the context of the scene and Clint's intentions that he's not ACTUALLY a creep, but he still exhibits creepy behaviors sometimes.\n\nIt's okay in a sense, because him not intending to at all means that he could learn how his behaviors come across sometimes and improve on them. But it doesn't mean it isn't creepy\n\nIf you don't call people out for their negative behaviors just because they don't *intend* to or the *context means he's just got shy* then they can't ever improve", "Having feelings is not a moral failing. It's not wrong to have feelings. Putting yourself first by *removing yourself from a situation that's hurting you* does not make you an asshole. \n\nNo one said Emily should apologize to Clint. Clint hasn't even made his feelings known to her. What *would* make him an asshole is if he confessed to her after knowing she has feelings for someone else, which *would* be putting that burden on Emily. It's way more considerate for him to distance himself and handle his feelings on his own.", "You want to tell me if you saw a well known very anxious friend hiding in a bush is the equivalent to seeing a complete stranger hiding in a bush infront of your house in a small village where people constantly cross paths, is exactly the same feeling to you? A big part of getting to know someone is to know how they are. If context and intent don't matter, then someone going into a bush to rescue an animal would also be on the same level according to your opinion, because ultimatively all that matters is what it looks like to someone from the outside.\n\nWhat do you want to call out with someone being socially inept and anxious? I'm actually a bit shocked that your recommendation for being around a person you frequently meet and know well, to repeatedly point out their issues. Take idk, a simple example, someone being overweight, and every time you meet them you point that out. That just sounds like a toxic mindset towards someone who did no harm to anyone else.", "I agree with everything here. But it still sucks for Emily in the situation and Clint is responsible for some of that too.", "Being overweight isn't a bad thing. Being overweight doesn't affect other people. People who are overweight are already aware they are overweight. Calling out physical attributes is not the same as telling your friend that this action comes off as creepy \n\nAnd I'm not saying call out his anxiety or his social ineptness. Say something like \"hey just so you know hiding in the bushes like that can come off kind of creepy.\" You SHOULD call out your friends if they have NEGATIVE BEHAVIORS that can affect people negatively or come off wrong. You CAN change behaviors, trying is the most important part. \n\nIdk why you think people shouldn't find it creepy just because \"he didn't mean it \ud83e\udd7a\" like if that's the case what's stopping ACTUAL creeps from claiming they just got shy and hid? Yes, idc I live in a town of 10 people. If I find someone ***hiding in the bushes in front of my house, I will be creeped out***\n\nAlso, if you go into the bush to rescue an animal, you're not *hiding in the bush,* you're rescuing an animal lol *hiding specifically in my bush would creep me out*\n\nJfc, if I saw a dude hiding in my bushes and it turns out he was just shy I just say \"hey I know you didn't mean it this way but I felt creeped out when you were in my bushes\" like\n\nwhy is it so wrong to call his behavior creepy sometimes??? you can be the best person on planet earth with the warmest and kindest intentions and still have negative behaviors that need pointing out sometime\n\nhow the hell are people ever actually supposed to get better if they don't realize how their behavior comes across and aren't ever called out for it?", "You can replace being overweight with anything else, if that doesnt suit the example for you, like having tourette - which if we dont consider context, is just calling out slurs (well, depending on the form, but to make it fitting we would take that one). \"Calling out actions\" and \"Calling out actions caused by anxiety\" are completely different things.\n\n>Say something like \"hey just so you know hiding in the bushes like that can come off kind of creepy.\"\n\nAnd...why would you assume that this leads to anything but the person next time not attempting to take a step? I don't understand why people often have this strong urge to always take on problems others have. Ironically, there is a great video I watched just yesterday, about over-taking responsibility. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Py7t7XIsILA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Py7t7XIsILA) I recommend giving this a watch as it pretty much describes (partially) this behavior. Where things are done or taken up as personal responsibility (in a way of saying: I should take this up and do it) that do not need to be taken care of, pretty much overstepping in their own right.\n\n>why is it so wrong to call his behavior creepy sometimes???\n\nYou keep acting as if I said creepy behavior shouldn't be called creepy. That's not what I said. I said I don't judge the behavior to be creepy in the first place, so saying that something shouldn't be deemed as wrong behavior is unfitting as that wasn't part of the whole point to begin with.\n\n>how the hell are people ever actually supposed to get better if they don't realize how their behavior comes across and aren't ever called out for it?\n\nI highly advise to watch the YouTube video, it's worth the watch and tackles pretty much exactly this, the illusion to think that someone plays a more significant role than they should. And I don't mean this as a condencending comment, I do pretty much a very similar thing out of care and/or to help, but it's a bit ironic to be the one deciding what needs help and it also being the thing that fulfills me - of course I view this action as positive since it has a positive feedback for me, but that doesn't mean it's the right thing to do.\n\nLet's just take this example. You have a highly anxious person, so anxious that, as a grown adult, you end up hiding in a bush to not confront the person you love. That's quite an extreme behavior. What do you think would your callout for it being creepy achieve? It's pretty much just a negative comment as all it does it point out an issue the person is already aware of. And we know that actually since a lot about Clints dialogue involves him giving up, ending up too scared to talk and even directly mentioning how this part of himself stands in his own way. In other words, all it would do is rubbing in how pathetic the bahvior is.", "People with tourette's literally can't control their tics... Clint can't control his social anxiety, but he can control not hiding in a bush in front of someone's house\n\n\nAlso???? you should be able to call out your friends if they do something that makes you uncomfortable or upsets you or whatever else??? like do you seriously think people should get away CONTROLLABLE behaviors (and if they legitimately can't contol them... then they need to seek professional help) that upset or make other people uncomfortable because \"they didn't mean it that way \ud83e\udd7a\" and \"it might hurt their feelings \ud83e\udd7a\"\n\nI already put up with 4 and 1/2 year of letting someone get away with behaviors that upset me because \"I don't want to hurt them\" and \"I know he doesn't mean it\" and all it got me was 4 1/2 years of trauma\n\nSo yes, if someone is making me uncomfortable or hurting me, unless it's LITERALLY uncontrollable like a tic, then I'm going to tell them. my feelings matter too", "That's as if you said \"people with tourette can't control their tourette, but they can control the words that they say\". It's both the same. Especially severe anxiety is pretty much a panic attack, which by definition refers to losing control, and the rest is pretty much just a question of intensity. But who are you to judge what is right or wrong for someone you have no insight with?\n\nAnd tbh with the amount of question mark spam and emoji use, you strike me more like someone acting like a kid. I'm not really interested in continuing this conversation, you show a lack of empathy for something rather basic and jump to conclusions that aren't even suitable in the given scenario. Just because you had a bad experience you don't need to project that onto others, it's unpleasant and you pretty much take the negative that happened to you and apply it automatically onto others, but with that you treat them exactly in the same way, just with the opposite kind of extreme.\n\nWe are talking about someone who jumped into a bush on the other side of the path. You don't need to change the scenario to suit your explanation. You completely miss the point that you made yourself, being that you want to help someone by pointing out their \"bad\" behavior, but this has as premis that the behavior needs to be bad to begin with. And whether something can or should be improved on someone else is simply not your position to judge - you can have an opinion, you can do things for yourself as you please, but again if we stay in the given scenario prescribed which we could clearly see in the linked video that shows the cutscene and without applying it to other unnecessary things, then you are simply overstepping and trying to do something you were unasked for. Which is unpleasant. And the irony here is that I am telling you exactly what you say should be done, just this time including you. I am telling you that your behavior is uncomfortable and offputting, but you just ignore it. Which should show the hypocrisy in the statement itself, regarding it's efficiency.", "No, people who have tourette's LITERALLY can't control their tics. And there isn't therapy to help their tics (afaik). If Clint's social anxiety so bad that he LITERALLY can't control jumping into a bush then he needs to get professional help, not have his behavior excused because \"he didn't mean it \ud83e\udd7a\" (also, if his anxiety is so bad he CANNOT control himself jumping into a bush, how did he work up the courage to walk over the first place? Or talk to Emily at all?) I get anxiety can get *really* bad but if it's *that* bad... I mean, it still doesn't make it okay? Shane is an asshole because he's an alcoholic and depressed and needs help. That doesn't mean him being an asshole is okay\n\nalso, I've always been an emoji type of person, and I use so many question marks because I am just getting increasingly baffled at the idea that people should be allowed to get away with behavior that makes other people uncomfortable or upset because \"he's just struggling. he didn't mean it\"", "Also want to add:\n\nImagine you lived in Stardew Valley and a friend came to you and said \"I found Clint hiding in my bushes and it made me uncomfortable and creeped out.\"\n\nYou wouldn't say \"Well, think of the poor guy! He didn't mean to. He just likes you and has really bad anxiety. Next time don't be so creeped out.\"\n\nWell, at least I would hope you wouldn't tell your friend they're wrong for being creeped out finding a man in their bushes, even one you and them both know, because \"he didn't mean to be creepy and therefore it's not creepy he hid in your bushes\""]},

I had previously made a bot for a friend of mine, so I already knew how to read Twitch chat programmatically, and I figured I could probably find a way to connect a program that reads chat to Stardew with a day or two of work.\n\nThe bot follows this pattern, which I'll break down into more detail below:\n\n1. Connect to my chat channel and listen for new messages\n2. If a message starts with one of the commands I have defined (like 'w' for move up or 'r' for right click) simulate that corresponding key-press on the system where SDV is running\n3. A program called \"AutoHotKey\" captures the key-press instead of SDV and sends a corresponding input to SDC\n4. The character executes the action sent\n\n**Chat Integration**\n\nReading chat with a program is largely a solved problem. There's a library available called [TwitchLib](https://github.com/TwitchLib/TwitchLib) that quickly gets you up and running if you already know some C#, follow the Readme and use their examples. Once the bot is connected to the channel you're targeting (in my case, my own channel), a portion of code is run every time someone sends a chat message. I wrote my own code to see if the first characters match any of my commands.\n\nThere's an interesting problem here. SDV expects continuous input, meaning the character moves as long as a movement key is held down and stops when the key is released. Twitch chat isn't able to hold down a button, so how can a chatter specify exactly how far they want the character to move? I have 16 discrete movement actions based on the number of repeating characters sent. Sending just 'w' points the character upwards and moves the character a tiny amount, but sending 'wwww' moves the character much further.\n\nMy first attempt at implementing this movement solution was to try to do it myself completely. There are functions available in C# that allow for simulated input. I could send a \"key down\" signal, wait a period of time based on how many repeating characters were sent, and send a \"key up\" signal. I got the input to work in an example Notepad document in windows, but SDV would not accept the simulated input. This makes sense because most game devs have some defenses against bots automatically playing their games (one of the reasons I selected SDV is because it can be run as a completely solo experience with no connection to the internet). However, I found after searching online, that a program called AutoHotKey worked with SDV.\n\n**AutoHotKey**\n\nThis program allows users complete freedom to define their own hotkeys, or button combinations to press in sequence in response to a single key-press. To resolve the issue of continuous vs discrete inputs in the previous section, I only had to define hotkeys for pressing the directional keys for a specific length of time. I can save the AutoHotKey script with my bot's code and all I have to do is launch the script with Administrator privileges to allow it to send input to SDV.\n\n**Beta-test**\n\nWith this mostly-hacked-together bot, I was able to run a basic test. I needed to run the stream on a system that wasn't my primary computer, as AutoHotKey can only send input to SDV if SDV is the currently active window. I had an old laptop that was decently powerful that I had relegated to the closet because I thought it was broken. I figured I'd give it one last chance and it turned out the Blue Screen of Death I was randomly getting was fixed by freeing up space on the hard drive. I installed SDV, my bot, and OBS and launched my beta test. A few friends of mine pitched in to test it and I quickly learned a few things\n\n1. I needed to have gamepad mode set to \"Force On\" for the cursor to work to browse menus with directional keys\n2. I needed to be able to let chat open the inventory menu\n3. The inventory menu includes the tabs for game settings and allows users to quit the game\n\nIf chat could access the settings menu, or quit the game, it would essentially allow the internet to break the stream. They could change the resolution, change the gamepad mode, quit the game entirely, or quit to the main menu and delete the farm. I needed a way to prevent chat from accessing those tabs, and there were no obvious mods that would help me do that.   \n  \nSoooooooooooooooo...............\n\n**Making my own mod**\n\nI was very hesistant to go down this route because I thought it would be a nightmare. Turns out, its relatively straightforward thanks to a generous modding community and [this great article.](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Modder_Guide/Get_Started) In about an hour I was able to get the working sample running. The challenge, however, is that doing anything beyond that point requires a significant amount of reverse engineering. The good news is that one of the libraries you input appears to just be the source code for the game and I could lookup any part of the code that I needed. I stumbled on a property that holds the reference to the displayed menu. In that menu, there's an integer value for the current tab, and that turned out to be the only variable I needed to work with. Whenever the variable hits one of the \"danger tabs\", I just set it back to one of the \"safe tabs\".\n\n**Next Steps**\n\nI have been running the stream for a few days, and a few people have stopped by to tinker around. I have no idea if this project will reach \"internet scale\", but I'd love to see how it could be broken. And if it doesn't break, I'd love to see the chaos created. I have thought about logging the top users in the channel based on sucessful control inputs, or the previous list of actions that have been taken. But overall I'm happy to have brought something I made to a release stage. I have the laptop running on the right side of my desk and it brings me a small bit of joy everyday to see the character moving around when someone stops by the stream and is curious enough to test it out.", "score": 13, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "created_utc": 1714430519.0, "num_comments": 11, "comments": ["Please\n\n#[VOTE](https://new.reddit.com/r/StardewValley/comments/1cc9yu9/new_removed_topics_games_journalism_sign_edits/) \n\nOn whether or not to add farmer profiles to the [list of removed topics](https://www.reddit.com/r/StardewValley/wiki/removed_topics).\n\n^(To maximize community input, this comment will run on posts until the poll closes on May 1.
